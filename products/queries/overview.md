# Queries Overview 

Wormhole Queries offer on-demand access to Guardian-attested on-chain data. They allow smart contracts to fetch real-time, verifiable data, such as prices, rates, and liquidity, from across the multichain ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **On-demand data access** – fetch price feeds, interest rates, and other data in real-time
- **Guardian attested** – all data is signed by Wormhole Guardians for trustless validation
- **Cross-chain ready** – eequest data on one chain, use it on another
- **Smart contract integration** – results are delivered as VAAs, readable by smart contracts
- **Chain agnostic** – works across supported EVM chains, Solana, Sui, and more

## How It Works


## Use Cases

Queries enable a wide range of cross-chain applications. Below are common use cases and the Wormhole stack components you can use to build them.

- **Borrowing and Lending Across Chains (e.g., [Folks Finance](https://wormhole.com/case-studies/folks-finance){target=\_blank})**

    - [**Messaging**](/docs/products/messaging/get-started/){target=\_blank} – coordinate actions across chains
    - [**Native Token Transfer**](/docs/products/native-token-transfers/get-started/){target=\_blank} – transfer collateral as native assets
    - [**Queries**](/docs/products/queries/get-started/){target=\_blank} – fetch rates and prices in real-time
