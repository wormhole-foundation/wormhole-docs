# Get Started with Queries

## Introduction

[Queries](/docs/products/queries/overview) lets you fetch on-chain data from supported blockchains using `eth_call`-style requests without submitting transactions or paying gas. The Guardian network signs the result, making it verifiable and suitable for use on-chain.

This guide walks you through requesting an API key, constructing your first query using the [Wormhole Query SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk){target=\_blank}, and decoding the result.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

 - [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank} 
 - A basic understanding of JavaScript or TypeScript
 - An RPC endpoint for a supported chain (e.g., Ethereum Sepolia)
 - A Wormhole Queries API key

## Request an API Key

Wormhole Queries is in closed beta, but you can start building today.

To interact with the system, you will use the Query Proxy. This hosted service receives your query, routes it to the appropriate chain, and returns a signed, verifiable response from the Guardian network. The Query Proxy allows you to fetch on-chain data without infrastructure overhead.

To request access, join the beta by filling out the [access form](https://forms.clickup.com/45049775/f/1aytxf-10244/JKYWRUQ70AUI99F32Q){target=\_blank}. Once approved, you will receive an API key via email.

## Construct a Query and Decode the Response

Using the Wormhole Query Proxy, you will write a lightweight script to query a token contract's `name()` on Ethereum Sepolia. The response is signed by the Guardian network and locally decoded for use in your application.

1. Create a new directory for your script and initialize a Node.js project:

    ```bash
    mkdir queries
    cd queries
    npm init -y
    ```

2. Add the [Wormhole Query SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk){target=\_blank}, [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios){target=\_blank}, [Web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3){target=\_blank}, and helper tools:

    ```bash
    npm install axios web3 @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk
    npm install -D tsx typescript
    ```

3. Add a new `query.ts` script where you will write and run your query logic:

    ```bash
    touch query.ts
    ```

4. Paste the following script into `query.ts` to build and submit a query to the token contract's `name()` function on Ethereum Sepolia, then decode the Guardian-signed response:

    ```typescript
    --8<-- "code/products/queries/get-started/snippet-1.ts"
    ```

5. Use your API key to execute the script:

    ```bash
    API_KEY=INSERT_QUERIES_API_KEY npx tsx query.ts
    ```

The expected output should be similar to this:

--8<-- "code/products/queries/get-started/snippet-2.html"

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully run your first verifiable query, you are ready to go deeper. Check out the following guides to build on what you've learned:

 - [Query Solana](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-queries-ts/blob/main/src/query_solana_stake_pool.ts){target=\_blank} – try fetching Solana stake pools to see how cross-chain queries apply beyond EVM
 - [Construct a Query](/docs/products/queries/guides/construct-a-query){target=\_blank} – understand how to build different query types using the SDK manually
 - [Verify a Query Response On-Chain](/docs/products/queries/guides/verify-response){target=\_blank} – use signed results in smart contracts

Browse the [Supported Networks](/docs/products/queries/reference/supported-networks){target=\_blank} to see where you can query today.
