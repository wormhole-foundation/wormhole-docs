# Live Crypto Price Widget

:simple-github: [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/e2e-tutorial-live-crypto-prices){target=\_blank}

In this tutorial, you'll build a widget that displays live crypto prices using [Wormhole Queries](/docs/products/queries/overview/){target=\_blank} and [Witnet](https://witnet.io/){target=\_blank} data feeds. You'll learn how to request signed price data from the network, verify the response, and show it in a responsive frontend built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/){target=\_blank} and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/){target=\_blank}.

Wormhole Queries make it possible to fetch verified off-chain data directly on-chain or in web applications without needing your own oracle infrastructure. Each response is cryptographically signed by the [Wormhole Guardians](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank}, ensuring authenticity and preventing tampering. By combining Queries with Witnet's decentralized price feeds, you can access real-time, trustworthy market data through a single API call, without managing relayers or custom backends.
