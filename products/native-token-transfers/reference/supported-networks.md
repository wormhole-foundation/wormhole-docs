# Supported Networks

This page lists all blockchain networks supported by the Native Token Transfers (NTT) protocol.

NTT enables native asset transfers between supported chains by deploying canonical token contracts on each network and using Wormhole messages to coordinate minting and burning. Support for a chain means the necessary NTT contracts are deployed and active on that chain's mainnet or testnet.

For more details on NTT architecture and deployment, see the [NTT Overview](/docs/products/native-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank} and [deployment guides](/docs/products/native-token-transfers/guides/deploy-to-evm/){target=\_blank}.
