# Supported Networks

This page lists all blockchain networks supported by Wormhole MultiGov, which enables decentralized governance across multiple blockchains.

Support for a chain means that MultiGov contracts are deployed and can participate in multichain governance actions, such as upgrades, proposals, or voting.
