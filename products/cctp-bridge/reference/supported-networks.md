# Supported Networks

This page lists all blockchain networks supported by Circle's CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol), used in Wormhole's native USDC transfer flows.

Support for a chain implies that the required CCTP and Wormhole contracts are deployed and configured, allowing USDC to be burned and minted across different chains.

For more details, see the [CCTP Overview](/docs/products/cctp-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank} and [Get Started guide](/docs/products/cctp-bridge/get-started/){target=\_blank}.
