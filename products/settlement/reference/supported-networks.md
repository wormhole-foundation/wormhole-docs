# Supported Networks

This page lists all blockchain networks supported by the Wormhole Settlement protocol, which enables fast, secure, and token-agnostic multichain payments.

Support for a chain means the Settlement contracts are deployed and can be used to initiate and complete payments between supported blockchains.

For more details, see the [Settlement Overview](/docs/products/settlement/overview/){target=\_blank} and [Get Started guide](/docs/products/settlement/get-started/){target=\_blank}.
