# Integrate Wormhole Settlement Routes Using the SDK

## Introduction

This guide explains integrating Wormhole Settlement Routes from the Wormhole SDK into your application. These Routes abstract the complexity of cross-chain token swaps by handling route discovery, fee estimation, and transaction construction, all useful for dApps seeking to embed cross-chain swaps. By following this tutorial you will install the Wormhole SDK Route package, configure and execute a swap, and explore error handling and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this project, make sure you have the following:

- **Wormhole SDK Route package** - installed using your preferred package manager

    To install the package with npm, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh
    npm install @mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route
    ```

    Alternatively, clone the repository and install dependencies:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route.git
    cd wormhole-sdk-route
    npm install
    ```

- **Data for parameters** - you will need: 
    
    - [Chain IDs](/docs/products/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} for the source and destination chains
    - An contract address for the token you want to swap and the token you want to receive on the destination chain

## Configure and Setup

To initiate a swap, you must create a configuration object that specifies all required parameters. These typically include:

- `sourceChain` - identifier for the chain where the swap begins
- `destinationChain` - identifier for the target chain
- `inputTokenAddress` - address of the token you want to swap
- `outputTokenAddress` - identifier/address of the desired token on the destination chain
- `amount` - the amount to swap (expressed in the smallest unit, e.g., wei for Ethereum)
- `slippageTolerance` - acceptable percentage of slippage (e.g., 0.005 for 0.5%)

```ts
import { SwapRoute, SwapRouteConfig } from '@mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route';

const config: SwapRouteConfig = {
  sourceChain: 'ethereum',
  destinationChain: 'solana',
  inputTokenAddress: '0xYourInputTokenAddress',
  outputTokenAddress: 'So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112', // Example token on Solana
  amount: '1000000000000000000', // For instance, 1 token in wei
  slippageTolerance: 0.005, // 0.5% slippage tolerance
  // Additional parameters may be included as needed
};

const swapRoute = new SwapRoute(config);
```

## Execute a Swap

Once the configuration is complete, the next steps are to retrieve the optimal swap route and execute the transaction.

### Fetch the Swap Route

Before sending a transaction, fetch the optimal swap route to review details such as fees and expected outputs:

```ts
async function getSwapDetails() {
  try {
    const routeDetails = await swapRoute.getRoute();
    console.log('Optimal Swap Route:', routeDetails);
    return routeDetails;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching swap route:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

getSwapDetails();
```

### Execute the Swap Transaction

Once the route is confirmed, execute the swap:

```ts
async function executeSwap() {
  try {
    const txResponse = await swapRoute.executeSwap();
    console.log('Swap executed successfully:', txResponse);
    // Further transaction handling (e.g., waiting for confirmation) can be added here.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Swap execution failed:', error);
  }
}

executeSwap();
```

## Complete Example Integration

Below is a complete example that puts together configuration, route fetching, and swap execution:

```ts
import { SwapRoute, SwapRouteConfig } from '@mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route';

async function performSwap() {
  // Configure the swap parameters
  const config: SwapRouteConfig = {
    sourceChain: 'ethereum',
    destinationChain: 'solana',
    inputTokenAddress: '0xYourInputTokenAddress',
    outputTokenAddress: 'So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112',
    amount: '1000000000000000000',
    slippageTolerance: 0.005,
    // Include additional settings as needed
  };

  // Initialize the swap route
  const swapRoute = new SwapRoute(config);

  try {
    // Retrieve the optimal swap route details
    const routeDetails = await swapRoute.getRoute();
    console.log('Optimal Swap Route:', routeDetails);

    // Execute the swap transaction
    const txResponse = await swapRoute.executeSwap();
    console.log('Swap Transaction Response:', txResponse);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred during the swap process:', error);
  }
}

performSwap();
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- **Route fetching errors** - ensure all configuration parameters (chain IDs, token addresses, amounts) are correct and that network endpoints are reachable
- **Transaction execution errors** - verify that the connected wallet has sufficient funds and that transaction parameters meet the network’s requirements. Detailed logging can assist with troubleshooting
- **Miscellaneous** - to pass a `ReferrerAddress` to the initiation functions, you can create a class that extends the `MayanRoute` class. Override the `referrerAddress` method to return addresses by platform, as shown in this example:

    ```ts
    class MayanRefRoute<N extends Network> extends MayanRoute<N> {
        override referrerAddress(): ReferrerAddresses | undefined {
            return { evm: "0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbe" };
        }
    }
    ```
