!!!note  
    Read-only deployments allow Wormhole messages to be received on chains not fully integrated with Wormhole Guardians. These deployments support cross-chain data verification but cannot originate messages. For example, a governance message can be sent from a fully integrated chain and processed on a read-only chain, but the read-only chain cannot send messages back.
