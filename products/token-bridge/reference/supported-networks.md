# Supported Networks

This page lists all blockchain networks supported by the Wormhole Token Bridge, which enables cross-chain transfers of wrapped assets between chains.

Support for a chain means the Token Bridge contracts are deployed and active, allowing users and dApps to transfer tokens to and from that chain.

For more details on how the Token Bridge works, see the [Overview](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank} and [Get Started guide](/docs/products/token-bridge/get-started/){target=\_blank}.
