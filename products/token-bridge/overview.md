# Token Bridge Overview

The Token Bridge is a Wormhole module for bridging and wrapping tokens across various blockchain networks. Locking assets on one network and minting corresponding wrapped tokens on another facilitates secure, efficient, and composable multichain token movement.

This overview covers Token Bridge's main features, general processes, and possible next steps to begin building a cross-chain application.

## Key Features

The Token Bridge is built to solve interoperability problems in multichain token transfers. Key features include:

- **Interoperability** - transfer standards-compliant tokens (e.g., ERC-20, SPL) across over 30 supported chains
- **Lock-and-mint mechanism** - mint wrapped tokens backed 1:1 by locked assets on the source chain
- **Preserved metadata** - ensure that token properties like name, symbol, and decimals persist across chains
- **Transfer with payload** - attach arbitrary data to token transfers, enabling the triggering of specific actions
- **Decentralized security** - verified by the [Guardian Network](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/), ensuring cross-chain consistency and message authenticity

## How It Works

By handling token movement in a decentralized, permissionless, and metadata-aware way, the Token Bridge provides a reliable foundation for cross-chain interoperability at scale.

The Token Bridge provides a reliable foundation for multichain interoperability at scale. The transfer process follows these key steps:

1. **Attestation** - the token’s metadata (e.g., symbol, name, decimals) is registered on the destination chain. This step is only required once per token
2. **Locking** - on the source chain, the native token is locked in a custody account
3. **Message emission** - the Guardian Network verifies and signs the transfer message
4. **Verification** - the signed message is submitted and verified on the destination chain to confirm authenticity
5. **Minting** - a wrapped version of the token is minted (or the native token is released) to the recipient on the destination chain

## Use Cases

Here are key use cases that highlight the power and versatility of the Token Bridge.

- **Multichain Rewards and Token Utility in Decentralized Platforms (e.g., [Chingari](https://chingari.io/){target=\_blank})** 

    - [**Token Bridge**](/docs/products/token-bridge/get-started/) – transfer tokens between chains
    - [**Messaging**](/docs/products/messaging/overview/) – facilitate the distribution and claiming processes of rewards

- **Tokenized Gaming Rewards**

    - [**Token Bridge**](/docs/products/token-bridge/get-started/) – handle the underlying lock-and-mint logic securely
    - [**Wormhole Connect**](/docs/products/connect/overview/) - provide a user-friendly way to move game tokens across chains
