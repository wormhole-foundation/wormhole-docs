# Run a Spy

## Introduction

The `Spy` is a lightweight component in the Wormhole infrastructure designed to listen for and forward messages (Verifiable Action Approvals, or VAAs) published on the Wormhole network. Running a Spy locally allows developers to subscribe to a filtered stream of these messages, facilitating the development of custom relayers or other integrations with Wormhole.

For a more comprehensive understanding of the Spy and its role within the Wormhole ecosystem, refer to the [Spy Documentation](/learn/infrastructure/spy/){target=\_blank}.

## How to Start a Spy

To start a Spy locally, run the following Docker command:

=== "TestNet"

    ```sh
    docker run --platform=linux/amd64 \
        -p 7073:7073 \
        --entrypoint /guardiand ghcr.io/wormhole-foundation/guardiand:latest \
        spy \
        --nodeKey /node.key \
        --spyRPC "[::]:7073" \
        --env testnet
    ```
        Optionally, add the following flags to skip any VAAs with invalid signatures:
    ```sh
    --ethRPC https://sepolia.drpc.org/
    --ethContract 0x4a8bc80Ed5a4067f1CCf107057b8270E0cC11A78    
    ```


=== "MainNet"

    ```sh
    docker run --platform=linux/amd64 \
        -p 7073:7073 \
        --entrypoint /guardiand ghcr.io/wormhole-foundation/guardiand:latest \
        spy \
        --nodeKey /node.key \
        --spyRPC "[::]:7073" \
        --env mainnet
    ```
    Optionally, add the following flags to skip any VAAs with invalid signatures:
    ```sh
    --ethRPC https://eth.drpc.org
    --ethContract 0x98f3c9e6E3fAce36bAAd05FE09d375Ef1464288B
    ```

Once running, a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/){target=\_blank} client (i.e., your program) can subscribe to a filtered stream of messages.

Use this [proto-spec file](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/proto/spy/v1/spy.proto){target=\_blank} to generate a client for the gRPC service.

!!! note
    If using JavaScript/TypeScript, the [Spydk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@certusone/wormhole-spydk){target=\_blank} makes setting up a client easier.
