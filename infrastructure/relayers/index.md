    This section guides you through developing your own custom off-chain relaying service, giving you greater control and flexibility than using Wormhole-deployed relayers.

    <br>

    Benefits of running your own relayer:

    - You can add logic to customize the delivery of messages
    - You can perform off-chain computations resulting in optimized gas costs

    <br>

    Requirements for running your own relayer:

    - You are responsible for developing and hosting your relayer
    - You are responsible for paying target chain fees
    - You are responsible for the liveness of your relayer
