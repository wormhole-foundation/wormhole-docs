Hey @Guardians! Thank you for passing governance to support **[Cosmos Chain]** via Wormhole Gateway. We are very excited to integrate with Wormhole!

We will be using **[Relayer Provider]** as our IBC relayer to support the connection to Wormhole Gateway. Their address is **[Wormhole Gateway address].** 

Could one of the Guardians please allowlist this address so that it can submit transactions to Wormhole Gateway?

We understand that if this address misbehaves, the sponsoring Guardian can remove it from the allowlist at any time, which would effectively shut down IBC bridging to/from our chain and Gateway.

Thank you!
