# Interacting with CCTP Bridge Contracts

Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) is a permissionless utility created by Circle to enable secure, efficient transfers of USDC across blockchain networks through native burning and minting, allowing developers to build multi-chain applications that simplify cross-chain transactions and improve liquidity without trust dependencies. For a full introduction to Circle's CCTP, please see the [CCTP guide in the learn section](/learn/messaging/cctp).

## CCTP Core Contracts Overview

Three core contracts make up CCTP:

- **`TokenMessenger`** - The entry point for cross-chain USDC transfers. Routes messages to initiate USDC burns on the source chain and mint USDC on the destination chain
- **`MessageTransmitter`** - Handles generic message passing. Sends messages from the source chain and receives them on the destination chain 
- **`TokenMinter`** - Responsible for the actual minting and burning of USDC. Utilizes chain-specific settings for both the burners and minters across different networks 

This guide will take a closer look at these contracts, paying careful attention to the methods that can be called, their respective parameters, and important events emitted  the contracts.

## TokenMessenger Contract

The `TokenMessenger` contract facilitates cross-chain USDC transfers by sending and receiving messages between blockchains. It works with the `MessageTransmitter` to relay messages for burning USDC on a source chain and minting it on a destination chain. It emits events to track deposits for burning and the subsequent minting of tokens on the destination chain. The contract ensures that only registered remote `TokenMessenger` contracts can handle messages, verifies proper conditions for burning tokens, and uses chain-specific settings to manage local and remote minters. Additionally, it provides methods for replacing or updating previously sent burn messages, adding or removing remote `TokenMessengers`, and managing the minting process for cross-chain transfers.

## MessageTransmitter Contract

The `MessageTransmitter` contract ensure the secure sending and receiving of messages across different blockchain domains. It manages message dispatch, incrementing a unique nonce for each message, and emitting events like `MessageSent` and `MessageReceived` to track communication. It ensures proper message format validation, attestation signatures, and nonce usage to prevent replay attacks. The contract supports flexible message delivery options, allowing for a specific `destinationCaller` or a general broadcast, and uses domain-specific configurations to handle communication. It also offers functionality to replace previously sent messages, set maximum message body sizes, and verify that messages can only be received once per nonce to maintain integrity across chains.

## TokenMinter Contract

The `TokenMinter` contract manages the minting and burning of tokens across different blockchain domains. It maintains a registry that links local tokens to their corresponding remote tokens, ensuring that tokens maintain a 1:1 exchange rate across domains. The contract only allows a designated `TokenMessenger` to call mint and burn functions, ensuring security and consistency in cross-chain operations. When tokens are burned on a remote domain, the corresponding token amount is minted on the local domain for a specified recipient, and vice versa. The contract includes mechanisms to pause operations, set burn limits, and update the `TokenController`, which governs token minting permissions. Additionally, it provides functionality to add or remove the local `TokenMessenger` and retrieve the local token address associated with a remote token.

    ```
