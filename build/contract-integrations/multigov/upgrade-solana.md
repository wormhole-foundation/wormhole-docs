# Upgrade MultiGov Contracts on Solana

The MultiGov Staking Program on Solana is designed to be upgradeable while maintaining stability. Upgrades introduce improvements, bug fixes, and new features but must be carefully planned and executed to prevent disruptions. 

This guide covers the key considerations and step-by-step process for upgrading the MultiGov Staking Program, including updating the program binary, Interface Description Language (IDL), and `HubProposalMetadata` while ensuring cross-chain compatibility.

## Key Considerations for Upgrades

- **Program upgradeability** - you can upgrade the MultiGov Staking Program on Solana using the `anchor upgrade` command 
    - You need the program's new bytecode (`.so` file) and an updated IDL file to reflect any changes in the program's interface to complete an upgrade
    - The program's authority (deployer) must execute the upgrade

- **`HubProposalMetadata`** - can be updated without redeploying the entire program. You can do this by invoking the `updateHubProposalMetadata` instruction
    - You must carefully validate updates to `HubProposalMetadata` to ensure compatibility with the existing system

- **Cross-chain compatibility** - ensure any changes to the Solana program do not break compatibility with the Ethereum-based `HubGovernor` 
    - Test upgrades thoroughly on devnet before deploying to mainnet

## Upgrade the MultiGov Program

Follow these steps to upgrade the MultiGov Staking Program on Solana.  

1. **Prepare the new program binary** - build the updated program using the provided script

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build_verifiable_staking_program.sh
    ```

    The new program binary will be located at:

    ```bash
    target/deploy/staking.so
    ```

2. **Upgrade the program** - use the anchor upgrade command to deploy the new program binary

    ```bash
    anchor upgrade --program-id INSERT_PROGRAM_ID --provider.cluster INSERT_CLUSTER_URL INSERT_PATH_TO_PROGRAM_BINARY
    ```

    Your completed anchor upgrade command should resemble the following:
    ```bash
    anchor upgrade --program-id DgCSKsLDXXufYeEkvf21YSX5DMnFK89xans5WdSsUbeY --provider.cluster https://api.devnet.solana.com ./target/deploy/staking.so
    ```

3. **Update the IDL** - after upgrading the program, update the IDL to reflect any changes in the program's interface

    ```bash
    anchor idl upgrade INSERT_PROGRAM_ID --filepath INSERT_PATH_TO_IDL_FILE
    ```

    Your completed IDL upgrade command should resemble the following:
    ```bash
    anchor idl upgrade --provider.cluster https://api.devnet.solana.com --filepath ./target/idl/staking.json DgCSKsLDXXufYeEkvf21YSX5DMnFK89xans5WdSsUbeY
    ```

4. **Update `HubProposalMetadata`** - if `HubProposalMetadata` requires an update, run the following script to invoke the `updateHubProposalMetadata` instruction and apply the changes

    ```bash
    npx ts-node app/deploy/07_update_HubProposalMetadata.ts
    ```
