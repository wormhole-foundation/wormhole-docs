# Wormhole NTT FAQs

## Do you have an example of how cross-chain lending can be implemented using Wormhole?

Yes, we have an example of cross-chain lending that leverages [Wormhole’s Token Bridge](/learn/messaging/token-nft-bridge/){target=\_blank}. In this example, collateral deposits (such as ETH on Ethereum) are bridged to a hub chain. Once the collateral is deposited, the borrowed assets, like wrapped BNB, are bridged to Binance Smart Chain. You can explore the full implementation in this [cross-chain lending example repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-wormhole-lending){target=_blank}.

Alternatively, you can also implement cross-chain lending using [Wormhole’s core messaging](/learn/messaging/native-token-transfers/){target=\_blank} instead of the Token Bridge, which avoids the limitations imposed by governor limits. ETH would be custodied on Ethereum, and BNB on the Binance spoke during this setup. When a user deposits ETH on Ethereum, a core bridge message is sent to the hub for accounting purposes. The hub then emits a message that can be redeemed on Binance to release the BNB. This approach allows for more direct asset control across chains while reducing reliance on Token Bridge limits.

## What causes the "No protocols registered for Evm" error in Wormhole SDK?

This error typically occurs when the [Wormhole SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank} cannot recognize or register the necessary EVM protocols, which are required for interacting with Ethereum-based networks. The most common reason for this error is that the relevant EVM package for Wormhole's NTT has not been imported correctly.

To resolve this issue, ensure you have imported the appropriate Wormhole SDK package for EVM environments. The necessary package for handling NTT on EVM chains is `@wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm-ntt`. Here's the correct import statement:

```rust
import '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm-ntt';
```

By importing this package, the Wormhole SDK can register and utilize the required protocols for EVM chains, enabling cross-chain token transfers using the NTT framework. Ensure to include this import at the start of your code, especially before attempting any interactions with EVM chains in your project.

## How can I transfer ownership of NTT to a multisig?

Transferring ownership of Wormhole's NTT to a multisig is a two-step process for safety. This ensures that ownership is not transferred to an address that cannot claim it. Refer to the `transfer_ownership` method in the [NTT Manager Contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/main/solana/programs/example-native-token-transfers/src/instructions/admin.rs#L16-L60){target=\_blank} to initiate the transfer.

1. **Initiate transfer** - use the `transfer_ownership` method on the NTT Manager contract to set the new owner (the multisig)
2. **Claim ownership** - the multisig must then claim ownership via the `claim_ownership` instruction. If not claimed, the current owner can cancel the transfer
3. **Single-step transfer (Riskier)** - you can also use the `transfer_ownership_one_step_unchecked` method to transfer ownership in a single step, but if the new owner cannot sign, the contract may become locked. Be cautious and ensure the new owner is a Program Derived Address (PDA)

## How can I specify a custom RPC for NTT?

To specify a custom RPC for Wormhole's NTT, create an `overrides.json` file in the root of your deployment directory. This file allows you to define custom RPC endpoints, which can be helpful when you need to connect to specific nodes or networks for better performance, security, or control over the RPC connection.

Below’s an example of how the `overrides.json` file should be structured:

???- code "`overrides.json`"
    ```json
    {
    "chains": {
        "Bsc": {
            "rpc": "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
        },
        "Sepolia": {
            "rpc": "http://127.0.0.1:8546"
        },
        "Solana": {
            "rpc": "http://127.0.0.1:8899"
        }
        }
    }
    ```

## How can I redeem tokens if NTT rate limits block them on the target chain?

If the rate limits on Wormhole's NTT block tokens from being received on the target chain, the transaction will typically be paused until the rate limits are adjusted. Rate limits are implemented to manage congestion and prevent chain abuse, but they can occasionally delay token redemptions.

To resolve this:

1. **Adjust rate limits** - the rate limits must be modified by an administrator or through the appropriate configuration tools to allow the blocked transaction to proceed
2. **Resume transaction flow** - once the rate limits are adjusted, you can resume the flow, which should be visible in the UI. The tokens will then be redeemable on the target chain

In most cases, the transaction will resume automatically once the rate limits are adjusted, and the UI will guide you through the redemption process.

## What are the challenges of deploying NTT to non-EVM chains?

NTT requires the same transceiver for all routes, limiting flexibility when deploying across EVM and non-EVM chains. For example, if you're deploying to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Solana, you can't use Wormhole and Axelar as transceivers because Axelar doesn't support Solana. This constraint forces integrators to use a single transceiver (e.g., Wormhole) for all chains, reducing flexibility in optimizing cross-chain transfers.

## Does the NTT manager function as an escrow account for a hub chain?

Yes, the NTT manager acts like an escrow account for non-transferable tokens on a hub chain. To manage non-transferable tokens, you would add the NTT manager to the allowlist, ensuring that only the NTT manager can hold and control the tokens as they are transferred across chains.

## Which functions or events does Connect rely on for NTT integration?

Connect relies on the NTT SDK for integration, with platform-specific implementations for both [Solana](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/main/solana/ts/sdk/ntt.ts){target=\_blank} and [EVM](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/ts/src/ntt.ts){target=\_blank}. The key methods involved include:

- **Initiate and redeem functions** - these functions are essential for initiating token transfers and redeeming them on the destination chain
- **Rate capacity methods** - methods for fetching inbound and outbound rate limits are also critical for controlling the flow of tokens and preventing congestion

These functions ensure Connect can handle token transfers and manage chain-rate limits.

## How does the relayer contract determine which transceiver to call?

The source chain's transceiver includes the destination chain's transceiver in the message via the relayer contract. The admin configures each transceiver's mapping of its peers on other chains. This mapping allows the destination transceiver to verify that the message came from a trusted source.
