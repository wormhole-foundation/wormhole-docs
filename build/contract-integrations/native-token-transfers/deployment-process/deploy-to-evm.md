# Native Token Transfers (NTT) EVM Development

## Deploy Your Token and Ensure Compatibility

If you still need to do so, deploy the token contract to the destination or spoke chains.

Tokens integrated with `NttManager` in `burning` mode require the following two functions to be present:

- `burn(uint256 amount)`
- `mint(address account, uint256 amount)`

These functions aren't part of the standard ERC-20 interface. The [`INttToken` interface](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/src/interfaces/INttToken.sol){target=\_blank} documents the required functions and convenience methods, errors, and events.

??? code "View the complete `INttToken` Interface`"
    ```solidity
    --8<-- 'code/build/contract-integrations/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/INttToken.sol'
    ```

Later, you set mint authority to the corresponding `NttManager` contract. You can also follow the scripts in the [example NTT token](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-ntt-token){target=\_blank} repository to deploy a token contract.

## Deploy NTT

Create a new NTT project:

```bash
ntt new my-ntt-deployment
cd my-ntt-deployment
```

Initialize a new `deployment.json` file, specifying the network:

=== "Testnet"

    ```bash
    ntt init Testnet
    ```

=== "Mainnet"

    ```bash
    ntt init Mainnet
    ```

Ensure you have set up your environment correctly: 

```bash
export ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Add each chain you'll be deploying to. The following example demonstrates configuring NTT in burn-and-mint mode on Ethereum Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia:

```bash
--8<-- 'code/build/contract-integrations/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/initialize.txt'
```

While not recommended, you can pass the `-skip-verify` flag to the `ntt add-chain` command if you want to skip contract verification.

The `ntt add-chain` command takes the following parameters:

- Name of each chain
- Version of NTT to deploy (use `--latest` for the latest contract versions)
- Mode (either `burning` or `locking`)
- Your token contract address

The NTT CLI prints detailed logs and transaction hashes, so you can see exactly what's happening under the hood.

## Configure NTT

The NTT CLI takes inspiration from [git](https://git-scm.com/){target=\_blank}. You can run:

- `ntt status` - checks whether your `deployment.json` file is consistent with what is on-chain
- `ntt pull` - syncs your `deployment.json` file with the on-chain configuration and set up rate limits with the appropriate number of decimals, depending on the specific chain. For example:

    For Solana, the limits are set with 9 decimal places:
      ```json
      "inbound": {
          "Sepolia": "1000.000000000" // inbound limit from Sepolia to Solana
      }
      ```

    For Sepolia (Ethereum Testnet), the limits are set with 18 decimal places:
      ```json
      "inbound": {
          "Solana": "1000.000000000000000000" // inbound limit from Solana to Sepolia
      }
      ```

    This initial configuration ensures that the rate limits are correctly represented for each chain's token precision
  
- `ntt push` - syncs the on-chain configuration with local changes made to your `deployment.json` file

After you deploy the NTT contracts, ensure that the deployment is properly configured and your local representation is consistent with the actual on-chain state by running `ntt status` and following the instructions shown on the screen.

## Set Token Minter to NTT Manager

The final step in the deployment process is to set the NTT Manager as a minter of your token on all chains you have deployed to in `burning` mode. When performing a hub-and-spoke deployment, it is only necessary to set the NTT Manager as a minter of the token on each spoke chain.

- If you followed the [`INttToken`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/src/interfaces/INttToken.sol){target=\_blank} interface, you can execute the `setMinter(address newMinter)` function
- If you have a custom process to manage token minters, you should now follow that process to add the corresponding NTT Manager as a minter

By default, NTT transfers to EVM blockchains support automatic relaying via the Wormhole relayer, which doesn't require the user to perform a transaction on the destination chain to complete the transfer.
