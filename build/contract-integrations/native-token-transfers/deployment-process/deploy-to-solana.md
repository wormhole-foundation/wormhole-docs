# Native Token Transfers (NTT) Solana Deployment

## Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

-  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install){target=\_blank} 
-  [Solana](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install){target=\_blank} **`{{ ntt.solana_cli_version }}`**
-  [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation){target=\_blank} **`{{ ntt.anchor_version }}`**

!!!Warning
    Ensure you are using the above versions of Solana and Anchor. Running the deployment with a different version may cause issues.

## Deploy NTT

Create a new NTT project (or use an existing NTT project):

```bash
ntt new my-ntt-deployment
cd my-ntt-deployment
```

Initialize a new `deployment.json` file specifying the network:

=== "Testnet"

    ```bash
	ntt init Testnet
    ```

=== "Mainnet"

    ```bash
	ntt init Mainnet
    ```

## Deploy Your Solana Token

???- interface "Deploy an SPL Token"

    1. Generate a new Solana key pair to create a wallet:
    ```bash
    solana-keygen grind --starts-with w:1 --ignore-case
    ```

    2. Set Solana configuration to use the new key pair created in step 1:
    ```bash
    solana config set --keypair INSERT_PATH_TO_KEYPAIR_JSON
    ```

    3. Set the Solana configuration to use the default RPC URL for Devnet:
    ```bash
    solana config set -ud
    ```

    4. Request an airdrop of two SOL and check the balance:
    ```bash
    solana airdrop 2 & solana balance
    ```

    5. Install or update the SPL Token CLI:
    ```bash
    cargo install spl-token-cli
    ```

    6. Create a new token with the SPL Token CLI (make sure you have enough balance to pay for the transaction):
    ```bash
    spl-token create-token
    ```

    7. Create a new account for the token created in step 6:
    ```bash
    spl-token create-account INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS
    ```

    8. Mint `1000` tokens to the created account:
    ```bash
    spl-token mint INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS 1000
    ```

!!! note
    NTT versions `>=v2.0.0+solana` support SPL tokens with transfer hooks.

### Deployment Mode Requirements

The NTT CLI supports two deployment models: **Hub-and-Spoke** and **Burn-and-Mint**.  
For a detailed explanation of these models, see the [Deployment Models](/docs/learn/messaging/native-token-transfers/deployment/){target=\_blank} page.

#### Hub-and-Spoke

No additional configuration is required for hub-and-spoke deployments. Tokens retain their original mint authority, so the steps below are not necessary. You can [generate a new NTT program key pair](/docs/build/contract-integrations/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/deploy-to-solana/#generate-ntt-program-key-pair) and [deploy the NTT program](/docs/build/contract-integrations/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/deploy-to-solana/#__tabbed_2_2) directly.

#### Burn-and-Mint

For burn-and-mint deployments, you must configure the token's mint authority to enable cross-chain transfers. To complete the required setup, follow the steps in the following sections.

## Configuration and Deployment

### Generate NTT Program Key Pair

When you deploy a Solana program, you need to hardcode the program ID (a Pubkey) into the program code. The NTT CLI allows you to do this seamlessly.

Generate a new NTT program key pair using:

```bash
solana-keygen grind --starts-with ntt:1 --ignore-case
```

### Derive Token Authority

In this step, you'll derive the token authority Program Derived Address (PDA) of the newly generated NTT program ID:

```bash
ntt solana token-authority INSERT_YOUR_NTT_PROGRAM_KEY_PAIR
```

This script will output the derived PDA, which you will use in the next step.

### Set SPL Token Mint Authority

!!!Warning
    You must create your token's metadata before delegating mint authority. [See an example on how to create metadata for your SPL token](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-metaplex-metadata){target=\_blank}.

If deploying in `burning` mode, you'll set the SPL token mint authority to the newly generated token authority PDA:

```bash
spl-token authorize INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS mint INSERT_DERIVED_PDA
```

!!! note
    Please ensure that you are using Anchor CLI version `0.29.0`. Running the deployment with a different version may cause compatibility issues.


### Deploy NTT

Generate or export your payer key pair, then run:

=== "Burn-and-Mint"

    ```bash
    ntt add-chain Solana --latest --mode burning --token INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS --payer INSERT_YOUR_KEYPAIR_JSON --program-key INSERT_YOUR_NTT_PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_JSON
    ```

=== "Hub-and-Spoke"

    ```bash
    ntt add-chain Solana --latest --mode locking --token INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS --payer INSERT_YOUR_KEYPAIR_JSON --program-key INSERT_YOUR_NTT_PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_JSON
    ```

!!! note
    The `add-chain` command accepts an optional `--solana-priority-fee` flag, which sets the priority fee in microlamports. The default is `50000`.

The NTT Solana program will then compile and deploy, returning the program ID.

!!! note
    Refer to the [Solana docs](https://solana.com/docs/programs/deploying#program-buffer-accounts){target=\_blank} for failed deployments, which provide instructions on finding buffer accounts and closing them to reclaim allocated SOL.

### Configure NTT

The NTT CLI takes inspiration from [git](https://git-scm.com/){target=\_blank}. You can run:

- `ntt status` - checks whether your `deployment.json` file is consistent with what is on-chain
- `ntt pull` - syncs your `deployment.json` file with the on-chain configuration and sets up rate limits with the appropriate number of decimals, depending on the specific chain. For example:

    For Solana, the limits are set with 9 decimal places:
      ```json
      "inbound": {
          "Sepolia": "1000.000000000" // inbound limit from Sepolia to Solana
      }
      ```

    For Sepolia (Ethereum Testnet), the limits are set with 18 decimal places:
      ```json
      "inbound": {
          "Solana": "1000.000000000000000000" // inbound limit from Solana to Sepolia
      }
      ```

    This initial configuration ensures that the rate limits are correctly represented for each chain's token precision.

### Deploy NTT to Solana

You can now push the deployment to the Solana network, specifying the key pair that will cover the gas fees:

```bash
ntt push --payer INSERT_YOUR_KEYPAIR_JSON
```

By default, NTT transfers to Solana support manual relaying, which requires the user to perform a transaction on Solana to complete the transfer. UI components such as Wormhole Connect support this out of the box.
