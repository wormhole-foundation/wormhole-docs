# Build Contract Integrations

## Get Started

The content in this section will teach you how to create smart contracts that integrate with Wormhole's messaging protocols, enabling your applications to send and receive messages across multiple blockchains. Discover the tools and techniques to build seamless cross-chain functionality into your decentralized applications.
