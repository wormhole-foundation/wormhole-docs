    The Wormhole TypeScript SDK exposes constants, contract interfaces, basic types, VAA payload definitions, EVM-specific utilities, and the EVM Token Bridge protocol client, combining convenience with the peace of mind of TypeScript type safety out of the box.

    ---

    Wormhole Queries offers on-demand access to Guardian-attested on-chain data via a simple REST endpoint. Wormhole Guardians, who run full nodes for various connected chains, facilitate this cross-chain query service. This method is faster and more cost-effective, eliminating the need for gas payments and transaction finality wait times.

    Wormhole Connect is a React widget that lets developers offer an easy-to-use interface to facilitate cross-chain asset transfers via Wormhole directly in a web application. Offering both code and no-code styling options, Wormhole Connect is highly customizable to meet the needs of your application.
