-   :octicons-checkbox-16:{ .lg .middle } **Wormhole Formatted Addresses**

    ---

    Learn how Wormhole formats addresses into a 32-byte hex format for cross-chain compatibility.
    
    This includes converting addresses between their native formats and the Wormhole format across multiple blockchains.
