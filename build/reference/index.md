# Reference

## Get Started

In this section, you'll find reference information that is essential for development. This includes Wormhole chain IDs, canonical contract addresses, and consistency levels for Guardians for each of the supported blockchains in the Wormhole ecosystem.

-   :octicons-list-ordered-16:{ .lg .middle } **Chain IDs**

    ---

    Find a mapping of Wormhole chain IDs to the names and network IDs of the supported blockchains.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-16: View list of chain IDs](/docs/build/reference/chain-ids/)

-   :material-timer-sand:{ .lg .middle } **Consistency Levels**

    ---

    See the levels of finality (consistency) a transaction should meet before being signed by a Guardian for each network.

-   :octicons-file-code-16:{ .lg .middle } **Contract Addresses**

    ---

    Discover the contract addresses for Wormhole-deployed contracts on each of the supported blockchains.

    This includes the following protocol contracts:

    - Core Contract
    - Token Bridge
    - NFT Bridge
    - Wormhole relayer
    - CCTP
    - Gateway

-   :material-code-braces:{ .lg .middle } **Wormhole Formatted Addresses**

    ---

    Learn how Wormhole formats addresses into a 32-byte hex format for cross-chain compatibility. 
    
    This includes converting addresses between their native formats and the Wormhole format across multiple blockchains.
