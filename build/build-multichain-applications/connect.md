# Connect React Widget

The Wormhole Typescript SDK is useful for interacting with the chains Wormhole supports and the [protocols](#protocols) built on top of Wormhole.

## Warning 

:warning: This package is a Work in Progress, so the interface may change, and there are likely bugs. Please [report](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/connect-sdk/issues) any issues you find. :warning:

## Installation

### Basic 

Install the (meta) package

```bash
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk
```

This package combines all the individual packages to make setup easier while allowing for tree shaking.  

### Advanced

Alternatively, for an advanced user, install a specific set of published packages.

```bash
# constants
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-base
# contract interfaces, basic types, vaa payload definitions
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-definitions
# Evm specific utilities
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm
# Evm TokenBridge protocol client
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm-tokenbridge
```

## Usage

Getting started is simple; just import Wormhole and the [Platform](#platforms) modules you wish to support

```ts
import { wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
```

??? code "View the complete script"
    ```ts hl_lines="2"
    --8<-- 'code/build/build-multichain-applications/wormhole-sdk/get-vaa.ts'
    ```

And pass those to the Wormhole constructor to make them available for use

```ts
--8<-- 'code/build/build-multichain-applications/wormhole-sdk/wormhole-init.ts'
```

??? code "View the complete script"
    ```ts hl_lines="16"
    --8<-- 'code/build/build-multichain-applications/wormhole-sdk/get-vaa.ts'
    ```

With a configured Wormhole object, we can do things like parse addresses for the platforms we passed, get a [ChainContext](#chain-context) object, or fetch VAAs.

<!--EXAMPLE_WORMHOLE_CHAIN-->
```ts
// Grab a ChainContext object from our configured Wormhole instance
const ctx = wh.getChain('Solana');
```

??? code "View the complete script"
    ```ts hl_lines="21"
    --8<-- 'code/build/build-multichain-applications/wormhole-sdk/get-vaa.ts'
    ```
