# Wormhole Connect

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Wormhole Connect is a customizable widget that brings native and wrapped token cross-chain asset transfers directly into your web applications in as few as 3 lines of code.

- Available as React component or hosted version via CDN
- Cross-chain transfers without the overhead of smart contract development or complicated configurations
- Configure any token to bridge via Wormhole

The pages in these sections cover features and benefits of Wormhole Connect, guidance on available token routes and when to use them, and configuration options to help you shape Connect to fit the needs of your application. Wormhole Connect allows you to easily customize details such as:

- Supported assets and RPC endpoints
- Multiple ways to bridge assets using ([routes](/docs/build/transfers/connect/routes/){target=\_blank})
- [Ability to drop off some gas](/docs/build/transfers/connect/features/#gas-drop-off){target=\_blank} at the destination

For more details about the features of Wormhole Connect and a breakdown of supported features by chain, be sure to check [the features page](/docs/build/transfers/connect/features/){target=\_blank}.

## See It In Action {: #see-it-in-action }

Wormhole Connect is deployed live in several production apps. Here are a few:

- [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/onboard/cctp){target=\_blank}
- [Pancake Swap](https://bridge.pancakeswap.finance/wormhole){target=\_blank}

Developers who want to implement cross-chain asset transfers with fully customized UI elements should visit the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/reference/sdk-docs){target=\_blank} documentation for guidance on using the SDK rather than Connect.
