# Native Token Transfers

Native Token Transfers (NTT) simplifies and enables seamless, flexible token transfers across blockchains. This section provides comprehensive guidance on configuring, deploying, and managing your NTT integration. It includes information relevant to both new token deployments and existing token management.

Visit the [Use Cases](/docs/build/start-building/use-cases/){target=\_blank} and [Product Comparison](/docs/build/start-building/products/){target=\_blank} pages for help determining if NTT will meet the needs of your project.

## Quickstart

If needed, you can generate test tokens for development with the [`example-ntt-token`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-ntt-token){target=\_blank} GitHub repository by following the README instructions.

The process for creating, deploying, and monitoring NTTs is as follows. Select the title of each step to view the associated guide:

## Deploy NTTs with Launchpad

If you are deploying to EVM blockchains, the [Native Token Transfers (NTT) Launchpad](https://ntt.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank} is a Wormhole-managed UI application that provides a step-by-step interface for deploying NTT. NTT Launchpad replaces manually deploying contracts or configuring relayers for each supported EVM chain. 

Follow the [Deploy NTT with Launchpad](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/){target=\_blank} guide to create new multichain tokens or integrate existing tokens with just a few clicks.
