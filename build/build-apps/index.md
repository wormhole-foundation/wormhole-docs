# Building Applications

Wormhole offers multiple tools to make your user-facing application integrations easier. Whether you are looking for a type safe friendly SDK, a React widget to enable user-friendly UI development, or on-demand API access to Guardian attestations, you'll find it here. 

## Wormhole TypeScript SDK

The Wormhole TypeScript SDK exposes constants, contract interfaces, basic types, VAA payload definitions, EVM-specific utilities, and the EVM Token Bridge protocol client, combining convenience with the peace of mind of TypeScript type safety out of the box.

## Wormhole Queries

Wormhole Queries offers on-demand access to Guardian-attested on-chain data via a simple REST endpoint. Wormhole Guardians, who run full nodes for various connected chains, facilitate this cross-chain query service. This method is faster and more cost-effective, eliminating the need for gas payments and transaction finality wait times.
