# NEAR

This page includes details for working with NEAR-environment chains

## Addresses

Because Wormhole works with many environments, the Wormhole address format is normalized. For NEAR-based chains, because NEAR addresses are arbitrary-length strings, a Wormhole formatted address is the sha256 hash of the address. E.g., `contract.portalbridge.near` => `0x148410499d3fcda4dcfd68a1ebfcdddda16ab28326448d4aae4d2f0465cdfcb7`.

## Emitter 

The emitter address on NEAR chains is the sha256 digest of the program address string, normalized to Wormhole address format.

## Wormhole Details

- Name: `near`
- Chain ID: `15`
- Contract Source: No source file

### Consistency Levels

The options for [`consistencyLevel`](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} (i.e., finality) are:

| Level     | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Finalized | 0     |

This field may be ignored since the chain provides instant finality.

For more information, see [the NEAR Consensus docs](https://nomicon.io/ChainSpec/Consensus){target=_blank}.
