# Products 

Wormhole provides a comprehensive suite of cross-chain solutions, enabling seamless asset transfers, data retrieval, and governance across blockchain ecosystems.

Wormhole provides multiple options for asset transfers: Connect for a plug-and-play bridging UI, Native Token Transfers (NTT) for moving native assets without wrapped representations, and Token Bridge for a secure lock-and-mint mechanism.

Beyond transfers, Wormhole extends interoperability with tools for cross-chain data access, decentralized governance, and an intent-based protocol through Wormhole Settlement.

## Transfer Products

Wormhole offers different solutions for cross-chain asset transfer, each designed for various use cases and integration requirements.

- [**Connect**](/docs/build/transfers/connect/overview/){target=\_blank} - a pre-built bridging UI for cross-chain token transfers, requiring minimal setup. Best for projects seeking an easy-to-integrate UI for bridging without modifying contracts
- [**Native Token Transfers (NTT)**](/docs/learn/transfers/native-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank} - a mechanism to transfer native tokens cross-chain seamlessly without conversion to wrapped asset. Best for projects that require maintaining token fungibility and native chain functionality across multiple networks
- [**Token Bridge**](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/){target=\_blank} - a bridging solution that uses a lock and mint mechanism. Best for projects that need cross-chain liquidity using wrapped assets and the ability to send messages
- [**Settlement**](/docs/learn/messaging/wormhole-settlement/overview/){target=\_blank} - intent-based protocols enabling fast multichain transfers, optimized liquidity flows, and interoperability without relying on traditional bridging methods

Beyond asset transfers, Wormhole provides additional tools for cross-chain data and governance.

## Real-time Data

[**Queries**](/docs/build/queries/overview/){target=\_blank} is a data retrieval service to fetch on-chain data from multiple networks. Best for applications that need multichain analytics, reporting, and data aggregation.

## Multichain Governance

[**MultiGov**](/docs/learn/governance/overview/){target=\_blank} is a unified governance framework that manages multichain protocol governance through a single mechanism. Best for projects managing multichain governance and protocol updates.
