# Supported Networks

Wormhole supports several different blockchains and environments. Since many of the concepts for using Wormhole within a given blockchain environment are the same, this section is organized by environment, and individual chains are detailed within the environment page.

## Supported Environments

- [EVM (Ethereum and compatible chains)](#evm)
- [SVM (Solana and compatible chains)](#svm)
- [CosmWasm (Cosmos ecosystem chains)](#cosmwasm)
- [AVM (Algorand)](#avm)
- [NEAR VM (NEAR)](#near-vm)
- [Move VM (Aptos)](#move-vm)
- [Sui Move VM (Sui)](#sui-move-vm)
