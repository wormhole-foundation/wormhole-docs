# Demos

This page features various demos showcasing Wormhole's features, including starter apps, cross-chain examples, and UI components for token transfers and lending protocols.

### Scaffolding

[Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding){target=\_blank} is a starter application repository that contains example dApps that integrate with Wormhole messaging. It includes basic xdapp structures, tests, and walkthroughs for core components like Wormhole messaging and the portal token bridge.

### Wormhole Examples

[Wormhole Examples](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-examples){target=\_blank} contains a variety of example components. It features a mix of relayers, cross-chain applications, NFT projects, and more.

### Basic Examples

[Basic Examples](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/xdapp-book/tree/main/projects){target=\_blank} features straightforward example projects that showcase minimum-code examples for how to send messages, tokens, and other standard functions.

### Native USDC Bridging

The [Native USDC Bridging](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-circle-integration){target=\_blank} repo demonstrates an integration of Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol using Wormhole.  

### Reference Bridge UI

[Reference Bridge UI](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-token-bridge-ui){target=\_blank} is an example GUI that can be used to perform token transfers around the ecosystem.

### Borrow Lend

[Borrow Lend](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-wormhole-lending){target=\_blank} contains two examples of cross-chain lending protocol implementations. The first example provides a basic lending skeleton for borrowing and lending between two chains. In contrast, the second example offers a more advanced cross-chain lending model using a hub-and-spoke approach.
