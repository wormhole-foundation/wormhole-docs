# Start Building

Begin your Wormhole builder journey here. This section includes essential information for supported networks and testnet faucets, product comparison and use cases to help you select the best tools to meet your user's needs, and demo applications to inspire and jumpstart your project.

## Networks and Faucets

- To review supported blockchains by environment, with links to block explorers and documentation resources for each network, see [Supported Networks](/start-building/supported-networks/)
- For help finding testnet tokens for a supported network, see [Testnet Faucets](/build/start-building/testnet-faucets/)

## Tools and Development Environment

- The [Wormholescan](https://wormholescan.io/) transaction explorer gives you access to realtime Wormhole analytics and transaction data
- The [Wormhole CLI](/build/toolkit/cli/) is a Swiss-Army knife utility command line tool for creating one-off VAAs, parsing VAAs, reading Wormhole contract configurations, and more
- Kubernetes developers can use [Tilt](/build/toolkit/tilt/) for cross-chain testing with Guardian nodes and relayers

## Products and Use Cases

The following table compares Wormhole tools and products to help you select the best fit for your project needs. For a more detailed look at each product, see the [Product Comparison Guide](#).

See [Use Cases](#) for examples of applying Wormhole products to solve specific problems.

## Essential Resources for Development

- Visit the [Reference](/build/reference/) section for information about chain IDs, contract addresses, consistency levels, and address formats
- To explore a collection of demo Wormhole projects, including starter apps, cross-chain examples, and UI components see [Demos](/build/start-building/demos/)
