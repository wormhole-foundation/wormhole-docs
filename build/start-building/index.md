# Start Building

Wormhole's role as a Generic Message Passing (GMP) protocol enables seamless interoperability across various aspects of project development. It provides a suite of powerful tools that support cross-chain communication and asset transfers, helping to create a unified ecosystem for developers building multichain solutions.

The following sections guide you to the tools and resources relevant to your development goals, whether integrating cross-chain functionality or enhancing infrastructure, with references and code examples to support your Wormhole integration. 

Unsure what you want to build?

- [Check out use cases](/docs/build/start-building/use-cases/){target=\_blank}
- [Compare products ](/docs/build/start-building/products/){target=\_blank}

Get ready to develop

- Choose networks you want to work with (see [supported networks](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/){target=\_blank})
- Get testnet tokens (see [testnet faucets](/docs/build/start-building/testnet-faucets/){target=\_blank})

## Create Your First Cross-Chain Transfer

There are several ways to interact with Wormhole, you can use:

- **TypeScript SDK** - leverage the Wormhole SDK to send cross-chain messages and assets programmatically

    [:custom-arrow: Explore tutorials](/docs/tutorials/)

- **Connect** - embed Wormhole's React bridging widget in your frontend app to allow users to transfer assets across chains easily
- **Contracts** - interact with Wormhole's smart contracts directly to facilitate cross-chain transfers
