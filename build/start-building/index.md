# Start Building

## Introduction

Wormhole's role as a Generic Message Passing (GMP) protocol means it facilitates interoperability across multiple areas of project development. The following sections will help you locate the tools most relevant to your development needs. 

Builders of cross-chain dApps will find tools like Wormhole TypeScript SDK, Connect, and Queries helpful for integrating Wormhole functionality without sacrificing user experience. 

Smart contract developers will find tools like Wormhole Relayer, Core Contracts, and the Wormhole Solidity SDK useful for creating protocols that seamlessly move assets between chains while maintaining security for protocol builders and users. Contract and protocol developers will also find guidance for setting up their local environment for various stages of the development process. 

This section also links to developer resources like references and helpful code examples. 

## Cross-chain DApp Developers
