# Start Building

Wormhole's role as a Generic Message Passing (GMP) protocol enables seamless interoperability across various aspects of project development. It provides a suite of powerful tools that support cross-chain communication and asset transfers, helping to create a unified ecosystem for developers building multichain solutions.

The following sections guide you to the tools and resources relevant to your development goals, whether integrating cross-chain functionality or enhancing infrastructure, with references and code examples to support your Wormhole integration.

## 
--
Unsure what you want to build?
- Check out use cases
- Compare products

Get ready to develop
- Choose networks you want to work with (see supported networks)
- Get testnet tokens (see testnet faucets)

Create your first transfer
- TypeScript SDK
- Direct contract integrations
- Connect


## Create Your First Cross-Chain Transfer

There are several ways to interact with Wormhole, you can use:

- **TypeScript SDK** - leverage the Wormhole SDK to send cross-chain messages and assets programmatically

    [:custom-arrow: Explore tutorials](/docs/tutorials/)

- **Connect** - embed Wormhole's React bridging widget in your frontend app to allow users to transfer assets across chains easily
- **Contracts** - interact with Wormhole's smart contracts directly to facilitate cross-chain transfers
