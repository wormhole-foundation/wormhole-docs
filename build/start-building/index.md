# Start Building

## Introduction

Wormhole's role as a Generic Message Passing (GMP) protocol means it facilitates interoperability across multiple areas of project development. The following sections will help you locate the tools most relevant to your development needs whether you are focused on building frontend user interfaces or smart contracts and protocols. This section also links to developer resources like references and code examples which are helpful for all builders looking to integrate with Wormhole. 

## Choose Your Development Pathway

-   :octicons-code-16:{ .lg .middle } **Build Frontend Applications**

    ---

    Build user-friendly frontends that interact with Wormhole's existing integrations, enabling your users to transfer assets, query information, and monitor cross-chain activity.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-16: Build frontend applications](/docs/build/applications/)

-   :octicons-checklist-16:{ .lg .middle } **Build Contract Integrations**

    ---

    Leverage Wormhole's powerful messaging protocols to create contracts that can communicate and interact across multiple blockchains. By using Wormhole’s core infrastructure, you can enable secure and seamless messaging, asset transfers, and more between supported networks.
