# Core Messaging

Wormhole-deployed relayers and Core Contracts are essential for sending and receiving multichain messages. Learning to work directly with these building blocks offers a deeper understanding of Wormhole and increased control and customization options. 

Follow the links below for how-to guides about using Core Contracts and Wormhole-deployed relayers to send, receive, validate, and track multichain messages. 

## Simplified Message Flow


Wormhole-deployed relayer support is limited to EVM environments. For a complete list of supported EVM environment blockchains, see the [Supported Networks](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/){target=\_blank} page.
