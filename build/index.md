# Build

## Quick Start

If you learn best by building, start here:

- [**Transfer Tokens via the Token Bridge**](/docs/tutorials/by-product/wormhole-sdk/tokens-via-token-bridge/){target=\_blank} - this tutorial takes you step-by-step through using the [Wormhole SDK's](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/){target=\_blank} Token Bridge method to move wrapped assets across networks.

- [**Transfer USDC via CCTP and Wormhole SDK**](docs/tutorials/by-product/wormhole-sdk/usdc-via-cctp/){target=\_blank} - this step-by-step tutorial combines [Wormhole SDK](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/){target=\_blank} and Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to bridge native USDC across networks.
