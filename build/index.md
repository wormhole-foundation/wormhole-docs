# Build Multichain

This section includes guides for selecting and using Wormhole products, tools, and contracts to connect your users to the leading multichain network of over 25 supported blockchains.

## Start Building

- See [Supported Networks](/build/start-building/supported-networks/) for a list of Wormhole supported chains
- Visit [Testnet Faucets](/build/start-building/testnet-faucets/) for a one-stop source to obtain tokens for testing your integrations
- Get inspired and jumpstart your build with [Demos](/build/start-building/demos/) including starter apps and example code

## Explore Products, Tools, and Use Cases

- Use the [Product Comparision Guide](#) to find the best combination of Wormhole products and tools to meet your user's needs
- See [Use Cases](#) for a look at what Wormhole makes possible

## Move Messages, Transfer Tokens

- To learn how to integrate smart contracts that send messages and data payloads or transfer tokens across chains, see [Transfer Protocols](/build/contract-integrations/) 

## Enhance Your Applications

- Explore the [Application Toolkit](/build/applications/) for tools to abstract away development complexity, integrate user and developer-friendly UI elements, and securely query on-chain data
