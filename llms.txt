# Get Started with Core Contracts

## Introduction

Wormhole's Core Contracts, deployed on each supported blockchain network, enable the fundamental operations of sending and receiving cross-chain messages.

While the implementation details of the Core Contracts varies by network, the core functionality remains consistent across chains. Each version of the Core Contract facilitates secure and reliable cross-chain communication, ensuring that developers can effectively publish and verify messages.

This guide will walk you through the variations and key methods of the Core Contracts, providing you with the knowledge needed to integrate them into your cross-chain contracts. To learn more about Core Contracts' features and how it works, please refer to the [Core Contracts](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} page in the Learn section.

## Prerequisites

To interact with the Wormhole Core Contract, you'll need the following:

- The [address of the Core Contract](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#core-contracts){target=\_blank} on the chains you're deploying your contract on
- The [Wormhole chain ID](/docs/build/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} of the chains you're deploying your contract on
- The [Wormhole Finality](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} (consistency) levels (required finality) for the chains you're deploying your contract on

## How to Interact with Core Contracts

Before writing your own contracts, it's essential to understand the key functions and events of the Wormhole Core Contracts. The primary functionality revolves around:

- **Sending messages** - submitting messages to the Wormhole network for cross-chain communication
- **Receiving and verifying messages** - validating messages received from other chains via the Wormhole network

While the implementation details of the Core Contracts vary by network, the core functionality remains consistent across chains.

### Sending Messages

To send a message, regardless of the environment or chain, the Core Contract is invoked with a message argument from an [emitter](/docs/learn/glossary/#emitter){target=\_blank}. This emitter might be your contract or an existing application such as the [Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/#token-bridge){target=\_blank}.

=== "EVM"

    The `IWormhole.sol` interface provides the `publishMessage` function, which can be used to publish a message directly to the Core Contract:

    ```solidity
    function publishMessage(
    uint32 nonce,
    bytes memory payload,
    uint8 consistencyLevel
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `nonce` ++"uint32"++
        
        A free integer field that can be used however you like. Note that changing the `nonce` will result in a different digest.

        ---

        `payload` ++"bytes memory"++
        
        The content of the emitted message. Due to the constraints of individual blockchains, it may be capped to a certain maximum length.

        ---

        `consistencyLevel` ++"uint8"++
        
        A value that defines the required level of finality that must be reached before the Guardians will observe and attest to emitted events.

    ??? interface "Returns"

        `sequence` ++"uint64"++
        
        A unique number that increments for every message for a given emitter (and implicitly chain). This, combined with the emitter address and emitter chain ID, allows the VAA for this message to be queried from the [Wormholescan API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}.
    
    ??? interface "Example"

        ```solidity
        IWormhole wormhole = IWormhole(wormholeAddr);

// Get the fee for publishing a message
uint256 wormholeFee = wormhole.messageFee();

// Check fee and send parameters

// Create the HelloWorldMessage struct
HelloWorldMessage memory parsedMessage = HelloWorldMessage({
    payloadID: uint8(1),
    message: helloWorldMessage
});

// Encode the HelloWorldMessage struct into bytes
bytes memory encodedMessage = encodeMessage(parsedMessage);

// Send the HelloWorld message by calling publishMessage on the
// wormhole core contract and paying the Wormhole protocol fee.
messageSequence = wormhole.publishMessage{value: wormholeFee}(
    0, // batchID
    encodedMessage,
    wormholeFinality()
);
        ```

=== "Solana"

    The `wormhole_anchor_sdk::wormhole` module and the Wormhole program account can be used to pass a message directly to the Core Contract via the `wormhole::post_message` function:

    ```rs
    pub fn post_message<'info>(
        ctx: CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, PostMessage<'info>>,
        batch_id: u32,
        payload: Vec<u8>,
        finality: Finality
    ) -> Result<()>
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `ctx` ++"CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, PostMessage<'info>>"++ 
        
        Provides the necessary context for executing the function, including the accounts and program information required for the Cross-Program Invocation (CPI).

        ??? child "Type `pub struct CpiContext<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T>`"

            ```rs
            pub struct CpiContext<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T>
            where
                T: ToAccountMetas + ToAccountInfos<'info>,
            {
                pub accounts: T,
                pub remaining_accounts: Vec<AccountInfo<'info>>,
                pub program: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub signer_seeds: &'a [&'b [&'c [u8]]],
            }
            ```

            For more information, please refer to the [`wormhole_anchor_sdk` Rust docs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/0.29.0/anchor_lang/context/struct.CpiContext.html){target=\_blank}.

        ??? child "Type `PostMessage<'info>`"

            ```rs
            pub struct PostMessage<'info> {
                pub config: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub message: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub emitter: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub sequence: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub payer: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub fee_collector: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub clock: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub rent: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub system_program: AccountInfo<'info>,
            }
            ```

            For more information, please refer to the [`wormhole_anchor_sdk` Rust docs](https://docs.rs/wormhole-anchor-sdk/latest/wormhole_anchor_sdk/wormhole/instructions/struct.PostMessage.html){target=\_blank}.

        ---

        `batch_id` ++"u32"++
        
        An identifier for the message batch.

        ---

        `payload` ++"Vec<u8>"++
        
        The data being sent in the message. This is a variable-length byte array that contains the actual content or information being transmitted. To learn about the different types of payloads, check out the [VAAs](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas#payload-types){target=\_blank} page.

        ---

        `finality` ++"Finality"++
        
        Specifies the level of finality or confirmation required for the message.
        
        ??? child "Type `Finality`"

            ```rs
            pub enum Finality {
                Confirmed,
                Finalized,
            }
            ```
    
    ??? interface "Returns"

        ++"Result<()>"++
        
        The result of the function’s execution. If the function completes successfully, it returns `Ok(())`, otherwise it returns `Err(E)`, indicating that an error occurred along with the details about the error
    
    ??? interface "Example"

        ```rust
        let fee = ctx.accounts.wormhole_bridge.fee();
// ... Check fee and send parameters

let config = &ctx.accounts.config;
let payload: Vec<u8> = HelloWorldMessage::Hello { message }.try_to_vec()?;

// Invoke `wormhole::post_message`.
wormhole::post_message(
    CpiContext::new_with_signer(
        ctx.accounts.wormhole_program.to_account_info(),
        wormhole::PostMessage {
            // ... Set fields
        },
        &[
            // ... Set seeds
        ],
    ),
    config.batch_id,
    payload,
    config.finality.into(),
)?;
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/solana/programs/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

Once the message is emitted from the Core Contract, the [Guardian Network](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} will observe the message and sign the digest of an Attestation [VAA](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}. On EVM chains, the body of the VAA is hashed twice with keccak256 to produce the signed digest message. On Solana, the [Solana secp256k1 program](https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs#secp256k1-program){target=\_blank} will hash the message passed. In this case, the argument for the message should be a single hash of the body, not the twice-hashed body.

VAAs are [multicast](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/#multicast){target=\_blank} by default. This means there is no default target chain for a given message. The application developer decides on the format of the message and its treatment upon receipt.

### Receiving Messages

The way a message is received and handled depends on the environment.

=== "EVM"

    On EVM chains, the message passed is the raw VAA encoded as binary. The `IWormhole.sol` interface provides the `parseAndVerifyVM` function, which can be used to parse and verify the received message.

    ```solidity
    function parseAndVerifyVM(
    bytes calldata encodedVM
) external view returns (VM memory vm, bool valid, string memory reason);
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `encodedVM` ++"bytes calldata"++
        
        The encoded message as a Verified Action Approval (VAA), which contains all necessary information for verification and processing.

    ??? interface "Returns"

        `vm` ++"VM memory"++
        
        The valid parsed VAA, which will include the original `emitterAddress`, `sequenceNumber`, and `consistencyLevel`, among other fields outlined on the [VAAs](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/) page.

        ??? child "Struct `VM`"

            ```solidity
            struct VM {
                uint8 version;
                uint32 timestamp;
                uint32 nonce;
                uint16 emitterChainId;
                bytes32 emitterAddress;
                uint64 sequence;
                uint8 consistencyLevel;
                bytes payload;
                uint32 guardianSetIndex;
                Signature[] signatures;
                bytes32 hash;
            }
            ```

            For more information, refer to the [`IWormhole.sol` interface](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/IWormhole.sol){target=\_blank}.

        ---
        
        `valid` ++"bool"++
        
        A boolean indicating whether the VAA is valid or not.
        
        ---

        `reason` ++"string"++
        
        If the VAA is not valid, a reason will be provided

    ??? interface "Example"

        ```solidity
        function receiveMessage(bytes memory encodedMessage) public {
    // Call the Wormhole core contract to parse and verify the encodedMessage
    (
        IWormhole.VM memory wormholeMessage,
        bool valid,
        string memory reason
    ) = wormhole().parseAndVerifyVM(encodedMessage);

    // Perform safety checks here

    // Decode the message payload into the HelloWorldMessage struct
    HelloWorldMessage memory parsedMessage = decodeMessage(
        wormholeMessage.payload
    );

    // Your custom application logic here
}
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/evm/src/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

=== "Solana"

    On Solana, the VAA is first posted and verified by the Core Contract, after which it can be read by the receiving contract and action taken.

    Retrieve the raw message data:

    ```rs
    let posted_message = &ctx.accounts.posted;
    posted_message.data()
    ```

    ??? interface "Example"

        ```rust
        pub fn receive_message(ctx: Context<ReceiveMessage>, vaa_hash: [u8; 32]) -> Result<()> {
    let posted_message = &ctx.accounts.posted;

    if let HelloWorldMessage::Hello { message } = posted_message.data() {
        // Check message
        // Your custom application logic here
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err(HelloWorldError::InvalidMessage.into())
    }
}
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/solana/programs/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

#### Validating the Emitter

When processing cross-chain messages, it's critical to ensure that the message originates from a trusted sender (emitter). This can be done by verifying the emitter address and chain ID in the parsed VAA.

Typically, contracts should provide a method to register trusted emitters and check incoming messages against this list before processing them. For example, the following check ensures that the emitter is registered and authorized:

```solidity
require(isRegisteredSender(emitterChainId, emitterAddress), "Invalid emitter");
```

This check can be applied after the VAA is parsed, ensuring only authorized senders can interact with the receiving contract. Trusted emitters can be registered using a method like `setRegisteredSender` during contract deployment or initialization.

```typescript
const tx = await receiverContract.setRegisteredSender(
  sourceChain.chainId,
  ethers.zeroPadValue(senderAddress as BytesLike, 32)
);

await tx.wait();
```

#### Additional Checks

In addition to environment-specific checks that should be performed, a contract should take care to check other [fields in the body](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}, including:

- **Sequence** - is this the expected sequence number? How should out-of-order deliveries be handled?
- **Consistency level** - for the chain this message came from, is the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} level enough to guarantee the transaction won't be reverted after taking some action?

The VAA digest is separate from the VAA body but is also relevant. It can be used for replay protection by checking if the digest has already been seen. Since the payload itself is application-specific, there may be other elements to check to ensure safety.

# Core Messaging

Wormhole-deployed relayers and Core Contracts are essential for sending and receiving multichain messages. Learning to work directly with these building blocks offers a deeper understanding of Wormhole and increased control and customization options. 

Follow the links below for how-to guides about using Core Contracts and Wormhole-deployed relayers to send, receive, validate, and track multichain messages. 

## Simplified Message Flow


Wormhole-deployed relayer support is limited to EVM environments. For a complete list of supported EVM environment blockchains, see the [Supported Networks](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/){target=\_blank} page.

# Wormhole Relayer

## Introduction

The Wormhole-deployed relayers provide a mechanism for contracts on one blockchain to send messages to contracts on another without requiring off-chain infrastructure. Through the Wormhole relayer module, developers can use an untrusted delivery provider to transport VAAs, saving the need to build and maintain custom relaying solutions. The option to [run a custom relayer](/docs/infrastructure/relayers/run-relayer/) is available for more complex needs.

This section covers the components and interfaces involved in using the Wormhole relayer module, such as message sending and receiving, delivery guarantees, and considerations for building reliable and efficient cross-chain applications. Additionally, you'll find details on how to handle specific implementation scenarios and track message delivery progress using the Wormhole CLI tool.

## Get Started with the Wormhole Relayer

Before getting started, it's important to note that the Wormhole-deployed relayer configuration is currently **limited to EVM environments**. The complete list of EVM environment blockchains is on the [Supported Networks](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/) page.

To interact with the Wormhole relayer, you'll need to create contracts on the source and target chains to handle the sending and receiving of messages. No off-chain logic needs to be implemented to take advantage of Wormhole-powered relaying.

</figure>

### Wormhole Relayer Interfaces

There are three relevant interfaces to discuss when utilizing the Wormhole relayer module:

- [**`IWormholeRelayer`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IWormholeRelayer.sol){target=\_blank} - the primary interface by which you send and receive messages. It allows you to request the sending of messages and VAAs
- [**`IWormholeReceiver`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IWormholeReceiver.sol){target=\_blank} - this is the interface you are responsible for implementing. It allows the selected delivery provider to deliver messages/VAAs to your contract
- [**`IDeliveryProvider`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IDeliveryProvider.sol){target=\_blank} - this interface represents the delivery pricing information for a given relayer network. Each delivery provider implements this on every blockchain they support delivering from

## Interact with the Wormhole Relayer

To start interacting with the Wormhole relayer in your contracts, you'll need to import the `IWormholeRelayer` interface and set up a reference using the contract address to the Wormhole-deployed relayer on the supported network of your choice.

To easily integrate with the Wormhole relayer interface, you can use the [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank}.

To retrieve the contract address of the Wormhole relayer, refer to the Wormhole relayer section on the [Contract Addresses](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#wormhole-relayer) reference page.

Your initial set up should resemble the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "wormhole-solidity-sdk/interfaces/IWormholeRelayer.sol";

contract Example {
    IWormholeRelayer public wormholeRelayer;

    constructor(address _wormholeRelayer) {
        wormholeRelayer = IWormholeRelayer(_wormholeRelayer);
    }
}
```

The code provided sets up the basic structure for your contract to interact with the Wormhole relayer using the address supplied to the constructor. By leveraging methods from the `IWormholeRelayer` interface, you can implement message sending and receiving functionalities. The following sections will detail the specific methods you need to use for these tasks.

### Send a Message

To send a message to a contract on another EVM chain, you can call the `sendPayloadToEvm` method provided by the `IWormholeRelayer` interface.

```solidity
function sendPayloadToEvm(
    // Chain ID in Wormhole format
    uint16 targetChain,     
    // Contract Address on target chain we're sending a message to
    address targetAddress,  
    // The payload, encoded as bytes
    bytes memory payload,   
    // How much value to attach to the delivery transaction 
    uint256 receiverValue,  
    // The gas limit to set on the delivery transaction
    uint256 gasLimit        
) external payable returns (
    // Unique, incrementing ID, used to identify a message
    uint64 sequence
);
```

!!! tip
    To reduce transaction confirmation time, you can lower the consistency level using the [`sendToEvm`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/v{{repositories.wormhole.version}}/sdk/js/src/relayer/relayer/send.ts#L33){target=\_blank} method.

The `sendPayloadToEvm` method is marked `payable` to receive fee payment for the transaction. The value to attach to the invocation is determined by calling the `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice`, which provides an estimate of the cost of gas on the target chain.

```solidity
function quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
    // Chain ID in Wormhole format
    uint16 targetChain,
    // How much value to attach to delivery transaction 
    uint256 receiverValue,
    // The gas limit to attach to the delivery transaction
    uint256 gasLimit
) external view returns (
    // How much value to attach to the send call
    uint256 nativePriceQuote, 
    uint256 targetChainRefundPerGasUnused
);
```

This method should be called before sending a message, and the value returned for `nativePriceQuote` should be attached to the call to send the payload to cover the transaction's cost on the target chain.

In total, sending a message across EVM chains can be as simple as getting a fee quote and sending the message as follows:

```solidity
// Get a quote for the cost of gas for delivery
(cost, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
    targetChain,
    valueToSend,
    GAS_LIMIT
);

// Send the message
wormholeRelayer.sendPayloadToEvm{value: cost}(
    targetChain,
    targetAddress,
    abi.encode(payload),
    valueToSend, 
    GAS_LIMIT
);
```

### Receive a Message

To receive a message using a Wormhole relayer, the target contract must implement the [`IWormholeReceiver`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-relayer-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/interfaces/IWormholeReceiver.sol){target=\_blank} interface, as shown in the [previous section](#interact-with-the-wormhole-relayer).

```solidity
function receiveWormholeMessages(
    bytes memory payload,           // Message passed by source contract 
    bytes[] memory additionalVaas,  // Any additional VAAs that are needed (Note: these are unverified) 
    bytes32 sourceAddress,          // The address of the source contract
    uint16 sourceChain,             // The Wormhole chain ID
    bytes32 deliveryHash            // A hash of contents, useful for replay protection
) external payable;
```

The logic inside the function body may be whatever business logic is required to take action on the specific payload.

## Delivery Guarantees

The Wormhole relayer protocol is intended to create a service interface whereby mutually distrustful integrators and delivery providers can work together to provide a seamless dApp experience. You don't trust the delivery providers with your data, and the delivery providers don't trust your smart contract. The primary agreement between integrators and delivery providers is that when a delivery is requested, the provider will attempt to deliver the VAA within the provider's stated delivery timeframe.

This creates a marketplace whereby providers can set different price levels and service guarantees. Delivery providers effectively accept the slippage risk premium of delivering your VAAs in exchange for a set fee rate. Thus, the providers agree to deliver your messages even if they do so at a loss.

Delivery providers should set their prices such that they turn a profit on average but not necessarily on every single transfer. Thus, some providers may choose to set higher rates for tighter guarantees or lower rates for less stringent guarantees.

## Delivery Statuses

All deliveries result in one of the following four outcomes before the delivery provider's delivery timeframe. When they occur, these outcomes are emitted as EVM events from the Wormhole relayer contract. The four possible outcomes are:

- (0) Delivery Success
- (1) Receiver Failure
- (2) Forward Request Success
- (3) Forward Request Failure

A receiver failure is a scenario in which the selected provider attempted the delivery but it could not be completely successfully. The three possible causes for a delivery failure are:

- The target contract does not implement the `IWormholeReceiver` interface
- The target contract threw an exception or reverted during the execution of `receiveWormholeMessages`
- The target contract exceeded the specified `gasLimit` while executing `receiveWormholeMessages`

All three of these scenarios can be avoided with correct design by the integrator, and thus, it is up to the integrator to resolve them. Any other scenario that causes a delivery to not be performed should be considered an outage by some component of the system, including potentially the blockchains themselves.

`Forward Request Success` and `Forward Failure` represent when the delivery succeeded and the user requested a forward during the delivery. If the user has enough funds left over as a refund to complete the forward, the forward will be executed, and the status will be `Forward Request Success`. Otherwise, it will be `Forward Request Failure`.

## Other Considerations

Some implementation details should be considered during development to ensure safety and a pleasant UX. Ensure that your engineering efforts have appropriately considered each of the following areas:

- Receiving a message from a relayer
- Checking for expected emitter
- Calling `parseAndVerify` on any additional VAAs
- Replay protection
- Message ordering (no guarantees on order of messages delivered)
- Forwarding and call chaining
- Refunding overpayment of `gasLimit`
- Refunding overpayment of value sent

## Track the Progress of Messages with the Wormhole CLI

While no off-chain programs are required, a developer may want to track the progress of messages in flight. To track the progress of messages in flight, use the [Wormhole CLI](/docs/build/toolkit/cli/) tool's `status` subcommand. As an example, you can use the following commands to track the status of a transfer by providing the environment, origin network, and transaction hash to the `worm status` command:

=== "Mainnet"

    ```bash
    worm status mainnet ethereum INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH
    ```

=== "Testnet"

    ```bash
    worm status testnet ethereum INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH
    ```

See the [Wormhole CLI tool docs](/docs/build/toolkit/cli/) for installation and usage.

# Deploy MultiGov on EVM

This guide provodes instructions to set up and deploy the MultiGov governance system locally. Before diving into the technical deployment, ensure that MultiGov is the right fit for your project’s governance needs by following the steps for the [integration process](/docs/build/multigov/){target=\_blank}.

Once your project is approved through the intake process and you’ve collaborated with the Tally team to tailor MultiGov to your requirements, use this guide to configure, compile, and deploy the necessary smart contracts across your desired blockchain networks. This deployment will enable decentralized governance across your hub and spoke chains.

## Prerequisites 

To interact with MultiGov, you'll need the following:

- Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank}
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target=\_blank}
- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/multigov
   cd evm # for evm testing/deploying
   ```

## Development Setup

For developers looking to set up a local MultiGov environment:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` with your specific [configuration](#configuration){target=\_blank}

3. Compile contracts:
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

4. Deploy contracts (example for Sepolia testnet): <!-- would be nice to cover the contracts before the deployment step -->

    For hub chains:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployHubContractsSepolia.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast
    ```

    For spoke chains (e.g., Optimism Sepolia):
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeploySpokeContractsOptimismSepolia.s.sol --rpc-url $OPTIMISM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast
    ```

## Configuration

When deploying MultiGov, several key parameters need to be set. Here are the most important configuration points:

### Hub Governor Key Parameters

- `initialVotingDelay` ++"uint256"++ - the delay measured in seconds before voting on a proposal begins. For example, `86400` is one day
- `initialProposalThreshold`  ++"uint256"++ - the number of tokens needed to create a proposal
- `initialQuorum` ++"uint256"++ - the minimum number of votes needed for a proposal to be successful
- `initialVoteWeightWindow` ++"uint256"++ - a window where the minimum checkpointed voting weight is taken for a given address. The window ends at the vote start for a proposal and begins at the vote start minus the vote weight window. The voting window is measured in seconds, e.g., `86400` is one day

    !!! note
        This helps mitigate cross-chain double voting.

### Hub Proposal Extender Key Parameters

- `extensionDuration` ++"uint256"++ - the amount of time, in seconds, for which target proposals will be extended. For example, `10800` is three hours
- `minimumExtensionDuration` ++"uint256"++ - lower time limit, in seconds, for extension duration. For example, `3600` is one hour

### Spoke Vote Aggregator Key Parameters

- `initialVoteWindow` ++"uint256"++ - the moving window in seconds for vote weight checkpoints. These checkpoints are taken whenever an address that is delegating sends or receives tokens. For example, `86400` is one day

    !!! note
        This is crucial for mitigating cross-chain double voting

### Hub Evm Spoke Vote Aggregator Key Parameters

- `maxQueryTimestampOffset` ++"uint256"++ - the max timestamp difference, in seconds, between the requested target time in the query and the current block time on the hub. For example, `1800` is 30 minutes

### Updateable Governance Parameters

The following key parameters can be updated through governance proposals:

- `votingDelay` - delay before voting starts (in seconds)
- `votingPeriod` - duration of the voting period (in seconds)
- `proposalThreshold` - threshold for creating proposals (in tokens)
- `quorum` - number of votes required for quorum
- `extensionDuration` - the amount of time for which target proposals will be extended (in seconds)
- `voteWeightWindow` - window for vote weight checkpoints (in seconds)
- `maxQueryTimestampOffset` - max timestamp difference allowed between a query's target time and the hub's block time

These parameters can be queried using their respective getter functions on the applicable contract.

To update these parameters, a governance proposal must be created, voted on, and executed through the standard MultiGov process.

# Deploy MultiGov on Solana  

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and deploy the **MultiGov Staking Program** on Solana. Before proceeding with the deployment, ensure that MultiGov aligns with your project's governance needs by reviewing the system [architecture](/docs/learn/governance/architecture/){target=\_blank}.

Once your project setup is complete, follow this guide to configure, compile, and deploy the necessary Solana programs and supporting accounts. This deployment enables decentralized governance participation on Solana as a spoke chain within the MultiGov system.  

## Prerequisites 

To deploy MultiGov on Solana, ensure you have the following installed:  

 - Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target=\_blank}  
 - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/){target=\_blank} **`v20.10.0`**
 - Install [Solana CLI](https://docs.anza.xyz/cli/install/){target=\_blank} **`v1.18.20`**
 - Install [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation){target=\_blank} **`v0.30.1`**
 - Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install){target=\_blank} **`v1.80.1`**
 - Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/){target=\_blank}
 - Clone the repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/multigov.git  
    cd multigov/solana/
    ```

## Build the Project

To create a verifiable build of the MultiGov Staking Program, run the following command:    

```bash
./scripts/build_verifiable_staking_program.sh
```

Once the build is complete, the compiled artifacts will be available in the `target` folder.

## Set Up the Deployer Account

For a successful deployment, you need a funded deployer account on Solana. This account will store the program and execute deployment transactions. 

In this section, you will create a new keypair, check the account balance, and ensure it has enough SOL tokens to cover deployment costs. If needed, you can fund the account using different methods before deploying. 

### Generate a New Keypair  

To create a new keypair and save it to a file, run the following command:  

```bash
solana-keygen new --outfile ./app/keypairs/deployer.json
```

### Check the Deployer Account Address  

To retrieve the public address of the newly created keypair, run the following command:  

```bash
solana address -k ./app/keypairs/deployer.json
```

### Check the Deployer Account Balance  

To verify the current balance of the deployer account, run the following command:  

```bash
solana balance -k ./app/keypairs/deployer.json
```

!!! important 
    When deploying the MultiGov Staking Program, the deployer account must have enough SOL to cover deployment costs and transaction fees.

    - 7.60219224 SOL for deployment costs
    - 0.00542 SOL for transaction fees

### Fund the Deployer Account  

If the account does not have enough SOL, use one of the following methods to add funds.  

 - **Transfer SOL from another account** - if you already have SOL in another account, transfer it using a wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.) or in the terminal 

    ```bash
    solana transfer <deployer_account_address> <amount> --from /path/to/funder.json
    ```

 - **Request an airdrop (devnet only)** - if deploying to devnet, you can request free SOL

    ```bash
    solana airdrop 2 -k ./app/keypairs/deployer.json
    ```

 - **Use a Solana faucet (devnet only)** - you can use online faucets to receive 10 free SOL

    - [Solana Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/){target=\_blank}

## Deploy the MultiGov Staking Program

With the deployer account set up and funded, you can deploy the MultiGov Staking Program to the Solana blockchain. This step involves deploying the program, verifying the deployment, and ensuring the necessary storage and metadata are correctly configured. Once the IDL is initialized, the program will be ready for further setup and interaction.

### Deploy the Program  

Deploy the MultiGov Staking Program using **Anchor**:  

```bash
anchor deploy --provider.cluster https://api.devnet.solana.com --provider.wallet ./app/keypairs/deployer.json
```

### Verify the Deployment  

After deployment, check if the program is successfully deployed by running the following command:  

```bash
solana program show INSERT_PROGRAM_ID
```

### Extend Program Storage  

If the deployed program requires additional storage space for updates or functionality, extend the program storage using the following command:  

```bash
solana program extend INSERT_PROGRAM_ID 800000
```

### Initialize the IDL  

To associate an IDL file with the deployed program, run the following command:  

```bash
anchor idl init --provider.cluster https://api.devnet.solana.com --filepath ./target/idl/staking.json INSERT_PROGRAM_ID
```

## Configure the Staking Program

The final step after deploying the MultiGov Staking Program is configuring it for proper operation. This includes running a series of deployment scripts to initialize key components and set important governance parameters. These steps ensure that staking, governance, and cross-chain communication function as expected.

### Run Deployment Scripts  

After deploying the program and initializing the IDL, execute the following scripts **in order** to set up the staking environment and necessary accounts.  

1. Initialize the MultiGov Staking Program with default settings:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node app/deploy/01_init_staking.ts
    ```

2. Create an Account Lookup Table (ALT) to optimize transaction processing:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node app/deploy/02_create_account_lookup_table.ts
    ```

3. Set up airlock accounts:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node app/deploy/03_create_airlock.ts
    ```

4. Deploy a metadata collector:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node app/deploy/04_create_spoke_metadata_collector.ts
    ```

5. Configure vote weight window lengths:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node app/deploy/05_initializeVoteWeightWindowLengths.ts
    ```

6. Deploy the message executor for handling governance messages:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node app/deploy/06_create_message_executor.ts
    ```

### Set MultiGov Staking Program Key Parameters  

When deploying MultiGov on Solana, several key parameters need to be set. Here are the most important configuration points:  

 - `maxCheckpointsAccountLimit` ++"u64"++ - the maximum number of checkpoints an account can have. For example, `654998` is used in production, while `15` might be used for testing
 - `hubChainId` `u16` - the chain ID of the hub network where proposals are primarily managed. For example, `10002` for Sepolia testnet
 - `hubProposalMetadata` ++"[u8; 20]"++ - an array of bytes representing the address of the Hub Proposal Metadata contract on Ethereum. This is used to identify proposals from the hub 
 - `voteWeightWindowLength` ++"u64"++ - specifies the length of the checkpoint window in seconds in which the minimum voting weight is taken. The window ends at the vote start for a proposal and begins at the vote start minus the vote weight window. The vote weight window helps solve problems such as manipulating votes in a chain 
 - `votingTokenMint` ++"Pubkey"++ - the mint address of the token used for voting  
 - `governanceAuthority` ++"Pubkey"++ - the account's public key with the authority to govern the staking system. The `governanceAuthority` should not be the default Pubkey, as this would indicate an uninitialized or incorrectly configured setup
 - `vestingAdmin` ++"Pubkey"++ - the account's public key for managing vesting operations. The `vestingAdmin` should not be the default Pubkey, as this would indicate an uninitialized or incorrectly configured setup
 - `hubDispatcher` ++"Pubkey"++ - the Solana public key derived from an Ethereum address on the hub chain that dispatches messages to the spoke chains. This is crucial for ensuring that only authorized messages from the hub are executed on the spoke

# FAQs

## Technical Questions

### How does MultiGov ensure security in cross-chain communication?

MultiGov leverages Wormhole's robust cross-chain communication protocol. It implements several security measures:

- Message origin verification to prevent unauthorized governance actions
- Timely and consistent data checks to ensure vote aggregation is based on recent and synchronized chain states
- Authorized participant validation to maintain the integrity of the governance process
- Replay attack prevention by tracking executed messages

### Can MultiGov integrate with any blockchain?

MultiGov can potentially integrate with any blockchain supported by Wormhole. However, specific implementations may vary depending on the chain's compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and its smart contract capabilities. [See the full list of supported networks](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/). The current implementation of MultiGov supports an EVM hub and both the EVM and SVM for spokes.

### How are votes aggregated across different chains?

Votes are collected on each spoke chain using each chain's `SpokeVoteAggregator`. These votes are then transmitted to the HubVotePool on the hub chain for aggregation and tabulation. The `HubEvmSpokeVoteDecoder` standardizes votes from different EVM chains to ensure consistent processing.

### Can governance upgrade from a single chain to MultiGov?

Yes! MultiGov can support progressively upgrading from a single-chain governance to MultiGov. Moving to MultiGov requires upgrading the token to NTT and adding Flexible Voting to the original Governor.

## Usage Questions

### How can I create a proposal in MultiGov?

Proposals are created on the hub chain using the `HubEvmSpokeAggregateProposer` contract or by calling `propose` on the `HubGovernor`. You need to prepare the proposal details, including targets, values, and calldatas. The proposer's voting weight is aggregated across chains using Wormhole queries to determine eligibility.

### How do I vote on a proposal if I hold tokens on a spoke chain?

You can vote on proposals via the `SpokeVoteAggregator` contract on the respective spoke chain where you hold your tokens. The votes are then automatically forwarded to the hub chain for aggregation.

### How are approved proposals executed across multiple chains?

When a proposal is approved and the timelock period elapses, it's first executed on the hub chain. A proposal can include a cross-chain message by including a call to `dispatch` on the `HubMessageDispatcher`, which sends a message to the relevant spoke chains. On each spoke chain, the `SpokeMessageExecutor` receives, verifies, and automatically executes the instructions using the `SpokeAirlock` as the `msg.sender`.

## Implementation Questions

### What are the requirements for using MultiGov?

To use MultiGov, your DAO must meet the following requirements:

- **ERC20Votes token** - your DAO's token must implement the `ERC20Votes` standard and support `CLOCK_MODE` timestamps for compatibility with cross-chain governance
- **Flexible voting support** - your DAO's Governor must support Flexible Voting to function as the Hub Governor. If your existing Governor does not support Flexible Voting, you can upgrade it to enable this feature

### What do I need to set up MultiGov for my project?

Get started by filling out the form below:

https://www.tally.xyz/get-started

Tally will reach out to help get your DAO set up with MultiGov.

To set up testing MultiGov for your DAO, you'll need:

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank} and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target=\_blank} installed
- Test ETH on the testnets you plan to use (e.g., Sepolia for hub, Optimism Sepolia for spoke)
- Modify and deploy the hub and spoke contracts using the provided scripts
- Set up the necessary environment variables and configurations

### Can MultiGov be used with non-EVM chains?

The current implementation is designed for EVM-compatible chains. However, Solana (non-EVM) voting is currently in development and expected to go live after the EVM contracts.

### How can I customize voting parameters in MultiGov?

Voting parameters such as voting delay, voting period, proposal threshold, and quorum (and others) can be customized in the deployment scripts (`DeployHubContractsSepolia.s.sol` and `DeploySpokeContractsOptimismSepolia.s.sol` as examples for their respective chains). Make sure to adjust these parameters according to your DAO's specific needs before deployment.

Remember to thoroughly test your MultiGov implementation on testnets before deploying to Mainnet, and have your contracts audited for additional security.

### How does MultiGov handle potential network issues or temporary chain unavailability?

MultiGov includes several mechanisms to handle network issues or temporary chain unavailability:

1. **Asynchronous vote aggregation** - votes are aggregated periodically, allowing the system to continue functioning even if one chain is temporarily unavailable
2. **Proposal extension** - the `HubGovernorProposalExtender` allows trusted actors to extend voting periods if needed, which can help mitigate issues caused by temporary network problems
3. **Wormhole retry mechanism** - Wormhole's infrastructure includes retry mechanisms for failed message deliveries, helping ensure cross-chain messages eventually get through
4. **Decentralized relayer network** - Wormhole's decentralized network of relayers helps maintain system availability even if some relayers are offline

However, prolonged outages on the hub chain or critical spoke chains could potentially disrupt governance activities. Projects should have contingency plans for such scenarios.

# Upgrade MultiGov Contracts on EVM

MultiGov is designed to be flexible but stable. Due to the system's complexity and cross-chain nature, upgrades should be rare and carefully considered. When upgrades are necessary, they must be meticulously planned and executed to ensure system integrity and continuity.

## Key Considerations for Upgrades

- **`HubGovernor`**:
    - Not upgradeable. A new deployment requires redeploying several components of the MultiGov system. Refer to the [Process for Major System Upgrade](#process-for-major-system-upgrade) section for more details 

- **`HubVotePool`**:
    - Can be replaced by setting a new `HubVotePool` on the `HubGovernor`
    - Requires re-registering all spokes on the new `HubVotePool`
    - Must register the query type and implementation for vote decoding by calling `registerQueryType` on the new `HubVotePool` <!-- put registerQueryType link back in once repo is public https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-multigov/blob/main/evm/src/HubVotePool.sol#L84 -->
    - A new proposal would have to authorize the governor to use the newly created hub vote pool and will also handle registering the appropriate query decoders and registering the appropriate spoke `SpokeVoteAggregators`

- **`SpokeMessageExecutor`**:
    - Upgradeable via [UUPS](https://www.rareskills.io/post/uups-proxy){target=\_blank} proxy pattern
    - Stores critical parameters in `SpokeMessageExecutorStorage`

- **`HubEvmSpokeAggregateProposer`**:
    - Needs redeployment if `HubGovernor` changes
    - Requires re-registering all spokes after redeployment

- **`HubProposalMetadata`**:
    - Needs redeployment if `HubGovernor` changes, as it references `HubGovernor` as a parameter

- **`SpokeMetadataCollector`**:
    - Requires redeployment if the hub chain ID changes or if `HubProposalMetadata` changes

## Process for Major System Upgrade 

1. **New `HubGovernor` deployment**:
    - Deploy the new `HubGovernor` contract
1. **Component redeployment**:
    - Redeploy `HubEvmSpokeAggregateProposer` with the new `HubGovernor` address
    - Redeploy `HubProposalMetadata` referencing the new `HubGovernor`
    - If hub chain ID changes, redeploy `SpokeMetadataCollector` on all spoke chains
1. **`HubVotePool` update**:
    - Set the new `HubVotePool` on the new `HubGovernor`
    - Register all spokes on the new `HubVotePool`
    - Register the query type and implementation for vote decoding (`HubEvmSpokeVoteDecoder`)
1. **Spoke re-registration**:
    - Re-register all spokes on the new `HubEvmSpokeAggregateProposer`
1. **Verification and testing**:
    - Conduct thorough testing of the new system setup
    - Verify all cross-chain interactions are functioning correctly
1. **System transition and deprecation**:
    - Create a proposal to switch the timelock to the new governor
    - Communicate clearly to the community what changes were made
1. **Monitoring**:
    - Implement a transition period where the new system is closely monitored
    - Address any issues that arise promptly

## Important Considerations

- Always prioritize system stability, upgrades should only be performed when absolutely necessary
- Thoroughly audit all new contract implementations before proposing an upgrade
- Account for all affected components across all chains in the upgrade plan
- Provide comprehensive documentation for the community about the upgrade process and any changes in functionality
- Always test upgrades extensively on testnets before implementing in production

# Upgrade MultiGov Contracts on Solana

The MultiGov Staking Program on Solana is designed to be upgradeable while maintaining stability. Upgrades introduce improvements, bug fixes, and new features but must be carefully planned and executed to prevent disruptions. 

This guide covers the key considerations and step-by-step process for upgrading the MultiGov Staking Program, including updating the program binary, Interface Description Language (IDL), and `HubProposalMetadata` while ensuring cross-chain compatibility.

## Key Considerations for Upgrades

- **Program upgradeability** - you can upgrade the MultiGov Staking Program on Solana using the `anchor upgrade` command 
    - You need the program's new bytecode (`.so` file) and an updated IDL file to reflect any changes in the program's interface to complete an upgrade
    - The program's authority (deployer) must execute the upgrade

- **`HubProposalMetadata`** - can be updated without redeploying the entire program. You can do this by invoking the `updateHubProposalMetadata` instruction
    - You must carefully validate updates to `HubProposalMetadata` to ensure compatibility with the existing system

- **Cross-chain compatibility** - ensure any changes to the Solana program do not break compatibility with the Ethereum-based `HubGovernor` 
    - Test upgrades thoroughly on devnet before deploying to mainnet

## Upgrade the MultiGov Program

Follow these steps to upgrade the MultiGov Staking Program on Solana.  

1. **Prepare the new program binary** - build the updated program using the provided script

    ```bash
    ./scripts/build_verifiable_staking_program.sh
    ```

    The new program binary will be located at:

    ```bash
    target/deploy/staking.so
    ```

2. **Upgrade the program** - use the anchor upgrade command to deploy the new program binary

    ```bash
    anchor upgrade --program-id INSERT_PROGRAM_ID --provider.cluster INSERT_CLUSTER_URL INSERT_PATH_TO_PROGRAM_BINARY
    ```

    Your completed anchor upgrade command should resemble the following:
    ```bash
    anchor upgrade --program-id DgCSKsLDXXufYeEkvf21YSX5DMnFK89xans5WdSsUbeY --provider.cluster https://api.devnet.solana.com ./target/deploy/staking.so
    ```

3. **Update the IDL** - after upgrading the program, update the IDL to reflect any changes in the program's interface

    ```bash
    anchor idl upgrade INSERT_PROGRAM_ID --filepath INSERT_PATH_TO_IDL_FILE
    ```

    Your completed IDL upgrade command should resemble the following:
    ```bash
    anchor idl upgrade --provider.cluster https://api.devnet.solana.com --filepath ./target/idl/staking.json DgCSKsLDXXufYeEkvf21YSX5DMnFK89xans5WdSsUbeY
    ```

4. **Update `HubProposalMetadata`** - if `HubProposalMetadata` requires an update, run the following script to invoke the `updateHubProposalMetadata` instruction and apply the changes

    ```bash
    npx ts-node app/deploy/07_update_HubProposalMetadata.ts
    ```

# Wormhole Queries FAQs

## What libraries are available to handle queries?

 - The [Query TypeScript SDK](https://npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk){target=\_blank} can be used to create query requests, mock query responses for testing, and parse query responses. The SDK also includes utilities for posting query responses

- The [Solidity `QueryResponseLib` library](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/libraries/QueryResponse.sol){target=\_blank} can be used to parse and verify query responses on EVM chains. See the [Solana Stake Pool](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-stake-pool){target=\_blank} repository as an example use case

- [`QueryRequestBuilder.sol`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/testing/QueryRequestBuilder.sol){target=\_blank} can be used for mocking query requests and responses in Forge tests

- The [Go query package](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/node/pkg/query){target=\_blank} can also be used to create query requests and parse query responses

!!! note
    A Rust SDK for Solana is being actively investigated by the Wormhole contributors. See the [Solana Queries Verification](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-verify){target=\_blank} repository as a proof of concept.

## Are there any query examples?

Certainly. You can find a complete guide on the [Use Queries page](/docs/build/queries/use-queries/){target=\_blank}. Additionally, you can find full code examples in the following repositories:

- [Basic Example Query Demo](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-demo/){target=\_blank}
- [Solana Stake Pool Example Query](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-stake-pool){target=\_blank}
- [Solana Program Derived Address (PDA) / Token Account Balance Example Query](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-pda){target=\_blank}
- [Solana Queries Verification Example](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-verify){target=\_blank}

## What is the format of the response signature?

The Guardian node calculates an ECDSA signature using [`Sign` function of the crypto package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.10.21/crypto#Sign){target=\_blank} where the digest hash is:

```keccak256("query_response_0000000000000000000|"+keccak256(responseBytes))``` 

See the [Guardian Key Usage](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0009_guardian_key.md){target=\_blank} white paper for more background. Once this signature is created, the Guardian's index in the Guardian set is appended to the end.

!!! note
    If you are used to `ecrecover` you will notice that the `v` byte is `0` or `1` as opposed to `27` or `28`. The `signaturesToEvmStruct` method in the [Query TypeScript SDK](https://npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk){target=\_blank} accounts for this as well as structuring the signatures into an `IWormhole.SignatureStruct[]`.

## Can anyone run a query proxy server?

Permissions for Query Proxy are managed by the Guardians. The Guardian nodes are configured to only listen to a set of allow-listed proxies. However, it is possible that this restriction may be lifted in the future and/or more proxies could be added.

It is also important to note that the proxies don't impact the verifiability of the request or result, i.e., their role in the process is trustless.

## What Does Queries Offer over an RPC Service

Wormhole Queries provides on-demand, attested, on-chain, verifiable RPC results. Each Guardian independently executes the specified query and returns the result and their signature. The proxy handles aggregating the results and signatures, giving you a single result (all within one REST call) with a quorum of signatures suitable for on-chain submission, parsing, and verification using one of our examples or SDKs.

# Queries Overview {: #queries-overview }

Wormhole Guardians, who run full nodes for various connected chains, facilitate a new cross-chain query service that allows for on-demand attested responses to queries, bypassing the inefficiencies of traditional transaction-based data retrieval. This method is faster and cost-effective, eliminating the need for gas payments and transaction finality wait times.

!!! note
	Queries are currently in closed beta, though you can start developing today. Check out [Use Queries](/docs/build/queries/use-queries/){target=\_blank} and reach out to [Join the beta](https://forms.clickup.com/45049775/f/1aytxf-10244/JKYWRUQ70AUI99F32Q){target=\_blank}.

Wormhole Queries offers on-demand access to Guardian-attested on-chain data. The current implementation provides integrators with a simple REST endpoint to initiate an off-chain request via a proxy. The proxy then forwards the request to the Guardians and gathers a quorum of responses. The result returns the encoded response, including the request details and the Guardian signatures. The request validation performed by the query module includes a three step process that involves verifying the signature to ensure it has the correct prefix, confirming that the signer is authorized to execute query requests, and validating the legitimacy of all per-chain requests contained in the query. You can read more about Queries in the [white paper](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0013_ccq.md){target=\_blank}.

## The Flow of a Query {: #the-flow-of-a-query}

The general overview of a query's flow is as follows: an off-chain process sends HTTPS query requests to a Query Proxy, which validates and forwards them to the Guardians; these Guardians independently validate, sign, and return the response, with the entire process typically taking less than a second.

![The architecture flow of a query](/docs/images/build/queries/overview/overview-1.webp)

The step-by-step flow of a query is as follows:

1. An off-chain process initiates a query request via HTTPS to the query proxy (or Query Server) 
2. The query proxy validates the request and forwards it to the Guardians via a gossip network
3. The Guardians independently validate the request, make the requisite RPC calls, verify the results, sign, and gossip a response back to the Query Proxy
4. The Query Proxy aggregates the results and returns a response when it reaches a quorum of two-thirds or more of the current Guardian set - the exact quorum requirements as the core bridge
5. The off-chain process can then submit these requests to an on-chain contract which should verify the signatures and validate the request before processing the result

In this flow, the Query Proxy is a permissioned but trustless part of the protocol. In most cases, this entire process takes less than one second. If a request is invalid or cannot be processed by the Guardians, they will retry for up to one minute before timing out. Requests can be batched to have the Guardians make multiple calls to multiple networks. This can further reduce overhead for processing query responses on-chain. Up to 255 queries can be batched together, with certain types allowing for batching themselves.

## Supported Query Types {: #supported-query-types}

There are currently five supported types of queries. See [the white paper](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0013_ccq.md){target=\_blank} for more details on each.

### eth_call {: #eth-call}

This query type is effectively an equivalent of [eth_call](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_call){target=\_blank} against a block specified by number or hash.

Calls are batched to allow specifying multiple calls (even to multiple contracts) against the same block. These calls are included in a single batch RPC call, simplifying on-chain verification. Up to 255 calls may be batched in an single `eth_call` query.

The result contains the specified block number, hash, timestamp, and the call result.

### eth_call By Timestamp {: #eth-call-by-timestamp}

This query type is similar to `eth_call` but targets a timestamp instead of a specific `block_id`. This can be useful when forming requests based on uncorrelated data, such as requiring data from another chain based on the block timestamp of a given chain.

The result also contains the target and block details with the following enforced conditions: `target_block.timestamp <= target_time < following_block.timestamp` and `following_block_num - 1 == target_block_num`.

### eth_call With Finality {: #eth-call-with-finality}

This query type is similar to `eth_call` but ensures that the specified block has reached the specified finality before returning the query results. The finality may be `finalized` or `safe.` Note that if a chain doesn't natively support the `safe` tag, this will be equivalent to `finalized.`

### sol_account {: #sol_account}

This query is used to read data for one or more accounts on Solana, akin to [`getMultipleAccounts`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getmultipleaccounts){target=\_blank}.

### sol_pda {: #sol_pda}

This query is used to read data for one or more [Program Derived Addresses(PDA)](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/pdas){target=\_blank} on Solana, akin to calling [`getMultipleAccounts`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getmultipleaccounts){target=\_blank} on the result of `PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(seeds, programId).` This query is helpful for times when you want to more generally read accounts owned by a program and verify the derivation on another chain, like how associated token accounts are all derived from the [Associated Token Account Program](https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account){target=\_blank}.

## Supported Chains {: #supported-chains}

The following table provides expected support based on testing. However, the success of any given query is based on the success of the underlying call on each Guardian’s RPC node.

For example, many chains have implementations forked from [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum){target=\_blank}, which keeps 128 blocks of state in memory by default (without running in archive mode). While this is good for about 25 minutes of history on Ethereum Mainnet, it is only about three minutes on Optimism. While Guardian nodes can be expected to have access to recent state, there are currently no guarantees of how far back in history they have access to.

### Mainnet {: #mainnet}

|     Chain     | Wormhole Chain ID | eth_call |    By Timestamp    | With Finality | Expected History |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:--------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|

# Use Queries

You can visit the [Example Queries Demo](https://wormholelabs-xyz.github.io/example-queries-demo/){target=\_blank} to view an interactive example of an application interacting with the [Query Demo](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-demo/blob/main/src/QueryDemo.sol){target=\_blank} contract.

This guide covers using a simple `eth_call` request to get the total supply of WETH on Ethereum.

## RPC Basics

Before digging into anything Queries-specific, this page will look at how to make an [`eth_call`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_call){target=\_blank} against a public Ethereum RPC. Suppose you'd like to query the WETH contract for its total supply; before making a request, you need some information about the contract you want to call, including:

- **To** - the contract to call. WETH is [0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2){target=\_blank}
- **Data** - the method identifier and ABI-encoded parameters, which can be obtained as follows: `web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("totalSupply()")` which yields `0x18160ddd`
- **Block ID** - the block number, hash, or tag. Tag options include `latest,` `safe,` or `finalized`

The prepared curl request is as follows:

```bash title="eth_call JSON-RPC request"
curl https://ethereum.publicnode.com -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_call","params":[{"to":"0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2","data":"0x18160ddd"},"latest"],"id":1}'
```

And the corresponding response is:

```bash title="eth_call JSON-RPC reponse"
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":1,
  "result":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000029fd3d129b582d7949e71"
}
```

Converting the returned value of the executed call from hexidecimal results in the value `3172615244782286193073777`. You can compare your result to the [**Read Contract**](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#readContract){target=\_blank} tab in Etherscan. Your result will be different as WETH is minted/burned over time.

## Construct a Query {: #construct-a-query}

You can use the [Wormhole Query SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk){target=\_blank} to construct a query. You will also need an RPC endpoint from the provider of your choice. This example uses [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios){target=\_blank} for RPC requests. Ensure that you also have [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/){target=\_blank} installed. 

```jsx
npm i @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk axios
```

In order to make an `EthCallQueryRequest`, you need a specific block number or hash as well as the call data to request.

You can request the latest block from a public node using `eth_getBlockByNumber`.

```jsx

await axios.post(rpc, {
      method: 'eth_getBlockByNumber',
      params: ['latest', false],
      id: 1,
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
    })
  ).data?.result?.number;
```

Then construct the call data.

```jsx
to: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2', // WETH
  data: '0x18160ddd', // web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("totalSupply()")
};
```

Finally, put it all together in a `QueryRequest`.

```jsx
const request = new QueryRequest(
    0, // Nonce
    [
      new PerChainQueryRequest(
        2, // Ethereum Wormhole Chain ID
        new EthCallQueryRequest(latestBlock, [callData])
      ),
    ]
  );
```

This request consists of one `PerChainQueryRequest`, which is an `EthCallQueryRequest` to Ethereum. You can use `console.log` to print the JSON object and review the structure.

```jsx

// {
//   "nonce": 0,
//   "requests": [
//     {
//       "chainId": 2,
//       "query": {
//         "callData": [
//           {
//             "to": "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
//             "data": "0x18160ddd"
//           }
//         ],
//         "blockTag": "0x11e9068"
//       }
//     }
//   ],
//   "version": 1
// }
```

## Mock a Query

For easier testing, the Query SDK provides a `QueryProxyMock` method. This method will perform the request and sign the result with the [Devnet](/docs/build/toolkit/tilt/){target=\_blank} Guardian key. The `mock` call returns the same format as the Query Proxy.

```jsx
const mockData = await mock.mock(request);
  console.log(mockData);
// {
//   signatures: ['...'],
//   bytes: '...'
// }
```

This response is suited for on-chain use, but the SDK also includes a parser to make the results readable via the client.

```jsx
const mockQueryResult = (
    mockQueryResponse.responses[0].response as EthCallQueryResponse
  ).results[0];
  console.log(
    `Mock Query Result: ${mockQueryResult} (${BigInt(mockQueryResult)})`
  );
// Mock Query Result: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000029fd09d4d81addb3ccfee (3172556167631284394053614)
```

Testing this all together might look like the following:

```jsx
import {
  EthCallData,
  EthCallQueryRequest,
  EthCallQueryResponse,
  PerChainQueryRequest,
  QueryProxyMock,
  QueryRequest,
  QueryResponse,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk';
import axios from 'axios';

const rpc = 'https://ethereum.publicnode.com';
const callData: EthCallData = {
  to: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2', // WETH
  data: '0x18160ddd', // web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("totalSupply()")
};

(async () => {
  const latestBlock: string = (
    await axios.post(rpc, {
      method: 'eth_getBlockByNumber',
      params: ['latest', false],
      id: 1,
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
    })
  ).data?.result?.number;
  if (!latestBlock) {
    console.error(`❌ Invalid block returned`);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Latest Block:     ', latestBlock, `(${BigInt(latestBlock)})`);
  const targetResponse = await axios.post(rpc, {
    method: 'eth_call',
    params: [callData, latestBlock],
    id: 1,
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
  });
  // console.log(finalizedResponse.data);
  if (targetResponse.data.error) {
    console.error(`❌ ${targetResponse.data.error.message}`);
  }
  const targetResult = targetResponse.data?.result;
  console.log('Target Result:    ', targetResult, `(${BigInt(targetResult)})`);
  // Form the query request
  const request = new QueryRequest(
    0, // Nonce
    [
      new PerChainQueryRequest(
        2, // Ethereum Wormhole Chain ID
        new EthCallQueryRequest(latestBlock, [callData])
      ),
    ]
  );
  console.log(JSON.stringify(request, undefined, 2));
  const mock = new QueryProxyMock({ 2: rpc });
  const mockData = await mock.mock(request);
  console.log(mockData);
  const mockQueryResponse = QueryResponse.from(mockData.bytes);
  const mockQueryResult = (
    mockQueryResponse.responses[0].response as EthCallQueryResponse
  ).results[0];
  console.log(
    `Mock Query Result: ${mockQueryResult} (${BigInt(mockQueryResult)})`
  );
})();
```

### Fork Testing

It is common to test against a local fork of Mainnet with something like

```jsx
anvil --fork-url https://ethereum.publicnode.com
```

In order for mock requests to verify against the Mainnet Core Contract, you need to replace the current Guardian set with the single Devnet key used by the mock.

Here's an example for Ethereum Mainnet, where the `-a` parameter is the [Core Contract address](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#core-contracts){target=\_blank} on that chain.

```jsx
npx @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-cli evm hijack -a 0x98f3c9e6E3fAce36bAAd05FE09d375Ef1464288B -g 0xbeFA429d57cD18b7F8A4d91A2da9AB4AF05d0FBe
```

If you are using `EthCallWithFinality`, you will need to mine additional blocks (32 if using [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/){target=\_blank}) after the latest transaction for it to become finalized. Anvil supports [auto-mining](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/#mining-modes){target=\_blank} with the `-b` flag if you want to test code that waits naturally for the chain to advance. For integration tests, you may want to simply `anvil_mine` with `0x20`.

## Make a Query Request

The standardized means of making a `QueryRequest` with an API key is as follows:

```jsx
const serialized = request.serialize();
const proxyResponse = (await axios.post)<QueryProxyQueryResponse>(
  QUERY_URL,
  {
    bytes: Buffer.from(serialized).toString('hex'),
  },
  { headers: { 'X-API-Key': YOUR_API_KEY } }
);
```

Remember to always take steps to protect your sensitive API keys, such as defining them in `.env` files and including such files in your `.gitignore`.

A Mainnet Query Proxy is available at `https://query.wormhole.com/v1/query`

## Verify a Query Response On-Chain

A [`QueryResponseLib` library](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/libraries/QueryResponse.sol){target=\_blank} is provided to assist with verifying query responses. You can begin by installing the [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank} with the following command:

```bash
forge install wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk
```

Broadly, using a query response on-chain comes down to three main steps:

   1. Parse and verify the query response
   2. The `parseAndVerifyQueryResponse` handles verifying the Guardian signatures against the current Guardian set stored in the Core bridge contract
   3. Validate the request details. This may be different for every integrator depending on their use case, but generally checks the following:
    - Is the request against the expected chain?
    - Is the request of the expected type? The `parseEthCall` helpers perform this check when parsing
    - Is the resulting block number and time expected? Some consumers might require that a block number be higher than the last, or the block time be within the last 5 minutes. `validateBlockNum` and `validateBlockTime` can help with the checks
    - Is the request for the expected contract and function signature? The `validateMultipleEthCallData` can help with non-parameter-dependent cases
    - Is the result of the expected length for the expected result type?
   4. Run `abi.decode` on the result 

See the [QueryDemo](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-demo/blob/main/src/QueryDemo.sol){target=\_blank} contract for an example and read the docstrings of the preceding methods for detailed usage instructions.

## Submit a Query Response On-Chain

The `QueryProxyQueryResponse` result requires a slight tweak when submitting to the contract to match the format of `function parseAndVerifyQueryResponse(bytes memory response, IWormhole.Signature[] memory signatures)`. A helper function, `signaturesToEvmStruct`, is provided in the SDK for this.

This example submits the transaction to the demo contract:

```jsx
const tx = await contract.updateCounters(
  `0x${response.data.bytes}`,
  signaturesToEvmStruct(response.data.signatures)
);
```

# Wormhole Finality

The following table documents each chain's `consistencyLevel` values (i.e., finality reached before signing). The consistency level defines how long the Guardians should wait before signing a VAA. The finalization time depends on the specific chain's consensus mechanism. The consistency level is a `u8`, so any single byte may be used. However, a small subset has particular meanings. If the `consistencyLevel` isn't one of those specific values, the `Otherwise` column describes how it's interpreted.

!!!note  
    Read-only deployments allow Wormhole messages to be received on chains not fully integrated with Wormhole Guardians. These deployments support cross-chain data verification but cannot originate messages. For example, a governance message can be sent from a fully integrated chain and processed on a read-only chain, but the read-only chain cannot send messages back.

# Wormhole Formatted Addresses

## Introduction

Wormhole formatted addresses are 32-byte hex representations of addresses from any supported blockchain. Whether an address originates from EVM, Solana, Cosmos, or another ecosystem, Wormhole standardizes all addresses into this format to ensure cross-chain compatibility.

This uniform format is essential for smooth interoperability in token transfers and messaging across chains. Wormhole uses formatted addresses throughout the [Wormhole SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank}, especially in cross-chain transactions, such as transfer functions that utilize the `bytes32` representation for recipient addresses.

## Platform-Specific Address Formats

Each blockchain ecosystem Wormhole supports has its method for formatting native addresses. To enable cross-chain compatibility, Wormhole converts these native addresses into the standardized 32-byte hex format.

Here’s an overview of the native address formats and how they are normalized to the Wormhole format:

| Platform        | Native Address Format            | Wormhole Formatted Address |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| EVM             |  Hex (e.g., 0x...)               |  32-byte Hex               |
| Solana          |  Base58                          |  32-byte Hex               |
| CosmWasm        |  Bech32                          |  32-byte Hex               |
| Algorand        |  Algorand App ID                 |  32-byte Hex               |
| Sui             |  Hex                             |  32-byte Hex               |
| Aptos           |  Hex                             |  32-byte Hex               |
| Near            |  SHA-256                         |  32-byte Hex               |

These conversions allow Wormhole to interact seamlessly with various chains using a uniform format for all addresses.

### Address Format Handling

The Wormhole SDK provides mappings that associate each platform with its native address format. You can find this mapping in the Wormhole SDK file [`platforms.ts`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/007f61b27c650c1cf0fada2436f79940dfa4f211/core/base/src/constants/platforms.ts#L93-L102){target=\_blank}:

```typescript
const platformAddressFormatEntries = [
  ['Evm', 'hex'],
  ['Solana', 'base58'],
  ['Cosmwasm', 'bech32'],
  ['Algorand', 'algorandAppId'],
  ['Sui', 'hex'],
  ['Aptos', 'hex'],
  ['Near', 'sha256'],
];
```

These entries define how the [`UniversalAddress`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/007f61b27c650c1cf0fada2436f79940dfa4f211/core/definitions/src/universalAddress.ts#L23){target=\_blank} class handles different address formats based on the platform.

## Universal Address Methods

The `UniversalAddress` class is essential for working with Wormhole formatted addresses. It converts native blockchain addresses into the standardized 32-byte hex format used across Wormhole operations.

Key functions:

 - **`new UniversalAddress()`** - use the `UniversalAddress` constructor to convert native addresses into the Wormhole format

    ```typescript
    const universalAddress = new UniversalAddress('0x123...', 'hex');
    ```

 - **`toUniversalAddress()`** - converts a platform-specific address into the Wormhole formatted 32-byte hex address

    ```typescript
    const ethAddress: NativeAddress<'Evm'> = toNative('Ethereum', '0x0C9...');
    const universalAddress = ethAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
    ```

 - **`toNative()`** - converts the Wormhole formatted address back to a native address for a specific blockchain platform

    ```typescript
    const nativeAddress = universalAddress.toNative('Evm');
    ```

 - **`toString()`** - returns the Wormhole formatted address as a hex string, which can be used in various SDK operations

    ```typescript
    console.log(universalAddress.toString());
    ```

These methods allow developers to convert between native addresses and the Wormhole format, ensuring cross-chain compatibility.

## Convert Between Native and Wormhole Formatted Addresses

The Wormhole SDK allows developers to easily convert between native addresses and Wormhole formatted addresses when building cross-chain applications.

### Convert a Native Address to a Wormhole Formatted Address

Example conversions for EVM and Solana:

=== "EVM"

    ```typescript
    import { toNative } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core';

const ethAddress: NativeAddress<'Evm'> = toNative(
  'Ethereum',
  '0x0C99567DC6f8f1864cafb580797b4B56944EEd28'
);
const universalAddress = ethAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
console.log('Universal Address (EVM):', universalAddress);
    ```

=== "Solana"

    ```typescript
    import { toNative } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core';

const solAddress: NativeAddress<'Solana'> = toNative(
  'Solana',
  '6zZHv9EiqQYcdg52ueADRY6NbCXa37VKPngEHaokZq5J'
);
const universalAddressSol = solAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
console.log('Universal Address (Solana):', universalAddressSol);
    ```

The result is a standardized address format that is ready for cross-chain operations.

### Convert Back to Native Addresses

Below is how you can convert a Wormhole formatted address back to an EVM or Solana native address:

```typescript
const nativeAddressEvm = universalAddress.toNative('Evm');
console.log('EVM Native Address:', nativeAddressEvm);

const nativeAddressSolana = universalAddress.toNative('Solana');
console.log('Solana Native Address:', nativeAddressSolana);
```

These conversions ensure that your cross-chain applications can seamlessly handle addresses across different ecosystems.

## Use Cases for Wormhole Formatted Addresses

### Cross-chain Token Transfers

Cross-chain token transfers require addresses to be converted into a standard format. For example, when transferring tokens from Ethereum to Solana, the Ethereum address is converted into a Wormhole formatted address to ensure compatibility. After the transfer, the Wormhole formatted address is converted back into the Solana native format.

### Smart Contract Interactions

In smart contract interactions, especially when building dApps that communicate across multiple chains, Wormhole formatted addresses provide a uniform way to reference addresses. This ensures that addresses from different blockchains can interact seamlessly, whether you're sending messages or making cross-chain contract calls.

### DApp Development

For cross-chain dApp development, Wormhole formatted addresses simplify handling user wallet addresses across various blockchains. This allows developers to manage addresses consistently, regardless of whether they work with EVM, Solana, or another supported platform.

### Relayers and Infrastructure

Finally, relayers and infrastructure components, such as Wormhole Guardians, rely on the standardized format to efficiently process and relay cross-chain messages. A uniform address format simplifies operations, ensuring smooth interoperability across multiple blockchains.

# Wormhole CLI

This tool is a command-line interface to Wormhole, allowing you to perform various actions, such as querying a transaction's status or submitting token transfers.

## Installation

Clone the repository and change directories to the appropriate directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole &&
cd wormhole/clients/js
```

Build and install the CLI tool:

```bash
make install
```

This installs two binaries, `worm-fetch-governance` and `worm` on your `$PATH`. To use `worm`, set up `$HOME/.wormhole/.env` with your private keys, based on `.env.sample` in this folder.

## Usage

You can interact with the Wormhole CLI by typing `worm` and including the `command` and any necessary subcommands and parameters.

## Examples

### VAA generation

Use `generate` to create VAAs for testing. For example, use the following command to create an NFT bridge registration VAA:

```bash
worm generate registration --module NFTBridge \
    --chain bsc \
    --contract-address 0x706abc4E45D419950511e474C7B9Ed348A4a716c \
    --guardian-secret cfb12303a19cde580bb4dd771639b0d26bc68353645571a8cff516ab2ee113a0
```

The below example generates a token attestation VAA:

```bash
worm generate attestation --emitter-chain ethereum \
    --emitter-address 11111111111111111111111111111115 \
    --chain ethereum \
    --token-address 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 \
    --decimals 6 \
    --symbol USDC \
    --name USDC \
    --guardian-secret cfb12303a19cde580bb4dd771639b0d26bc68353645571a8cff516ab2ee113a0
```

### VAA parsing

Use `parse` to parse a VAA into JSON:

```bash
worm parse $(worm-fetch-governance 13940208096455381020)
```

This example will fetch governance VAA `13940208096455381020` and print it as JSON: 

```bash
# ...signatures elided

emitterAddress: '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004',

  ]
}
```

### Submitting VAAs

Use `submit` to submit a VAA to a chain. It first parses the VAA and determines the destination chain and module. For example, a contract upgrade contains both the target chain and module, so the only required argument is the network moniker (`mainnet` or `testnet`):

```bash
worm submit $(cat my-nft-registration.txt) --network mainnet
```

The script will ask you to specify the target chain for VAAs that don't have a specific target chain (like registrations or Guardian set upgrades). For example, to submit a Guardian set upgrade on all chains, simply run:

```bash
worm-fetch-governance 13940208096455381020 > guardian-upgrade.txt
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain oasis
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain aurora
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain fantom
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain karura
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain acala
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain klaytn
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain avalanche
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain polygon
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain bsc
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain solana
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain terra
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain ethereum
worm submit $(cat guardian-upgrade.txt) --network mainnet --chain celo
```

The VAA payload type (Guardian set upgrade) specifies that this VAA should go to the core bridge, and the tool directs it there.

### Getting Info

To get info about a contract (only EVM supported at this time), use the following command:

```bash
worm evm info -c bsc -n mainnet -m TokenBridge
```

Running this command generates the following output:

```bash

# Development Environment

Developers building for smart contract integration will want to set up a development environment to allow testing the full integration, possibly including VAA generation and relaying.

## Tooling Installation

The [Wormhole CLI Tool](/docs/build/toolkit/cli/){target=\_blank} should be installed regardless of the environments chosen. Each environment has its own set of recommended tools. To begin working with a specific environment, see the recommended tools on the respective [environment page](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/){target=\_blank}.

## Development Stages

Different approaches to development and testing are recommended at various stages of application development.

### Initial Development

During the initial development of an on-chain application, the best option is to use the native tools available in the environment. You can visit the following resources for more information:

- **[Environment](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole){target=\_blank}** - select the folder for the desired network to learn about the recommended native toolset  
- **[Mock Guardian](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/sdk/js/src/mock/wormhole.ts){target=\_blank}** - it's recommended to set up a mock Guardian or Emitter to provide signed VAAsFor any program methods that require some message be sent or received. 
- **[Wormhole Scaffolding repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/blob/main/evm/ts-test/01_hello_world.ts){target=\_blank}** - example mock Guardian test

Relying on native tools when possible allows for more rapid prototyping and iteration.  

### Integration

For integration to Wormhole and with multiple chains, the simplest option is to use the chains' Testnets. In choosing which chains to use for integration testing, consider which chains in a given environment provide easy access to Testnet tokens and where block times are fast. Find links for Testnet faucets in the [blockchain details section](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/){target=\_blank}. A developer may prefer standing up a set of local validators instead of using the Testnet. For this option, [Tilt](/docs/build/toolkit/tilt/){target=\_blank} is available to run local instances of all the chains Wormhole supports.

!!! note
    Variation in host environments causes unique issues, and the computational intensity of multiple simultaneous local validators can make setting them up difficult or time-consuming. You may prefer Testnets for the simplest integration testing.

### Prepare for Deployment

Once you've finished the application's initial development and performed integration testing, you should set up a CI test environment. The best option for that is likely to be [Tilt](/docs/build/toolkit/tilt/){target=\_blank} since it allows you to spin up any chains supported by Wormhole in a consistent environment.

## Validator Setup with Tilt

### Tilt
If you'd like to set up a local validator environment, follow the setup guide for Tilt. Tilt is a full-fledged Kubernetes deployment of every chain connected to Wormhole, along with a Guardian node. It usually takes 30 minutes to spin up fully, but it comes with all chains running out of the box. Refer to the [Tilt](/docs/build/toolkit/tilt/){target=\_blank} page for a complete guide to setting up and configuring Tilt.

## Deploying to Public Networks

### Testnet

When doing integration testing on Testnets, remember that a single Guardian node is watching for transactions on various test networks. Because Testnets only have a single Guardian, there's a slight chance that your VAAs won't be processed. This rate doesn't indicate performance on Mainnet, where 19 Guardians are watching for transactions. The Testnet contract addresses are available on the page for each [environment](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/){target=\_blank}. The [Wormholescan API](https://docs.wormholescan.io){target=\_blank} offers the following Guardian equivalent Testnet endpoint:

```text
https://api.testnet.wormholescan.io
```

### Mainnet

The Mainnet contract addresses are available on the page for each [environment](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/){target=\_blank}. The [Wormholescan API](https://docs.wormholescan.io){target=\_blank} offers the following Guardian equivalent Mainnet endpoint:

```text
https://api.wormholescan.io
```

# Toolkit FAQs

## Why does the `toNative` function in the TypeScript SDK return an error?

The `toNative` function may return an error if the platform-specific module (such as Solana or EVM) is not correctly imported or passed into the Wormhole constructor.

To fix this, ensure the relevant platform module is imported and included when initializing Wormhole. For example, if you're working with Solana, make sure to import the Solana module and pass it into the Wormhole constructor like this:

```typescript
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [solana]);
```

## How can I retrieve the history of previously bridged transactions?

To retrieve the history of previously bridged transactions, you can use the Wormholescan API. Use the following endpoint to query the transaction history for a specific address:

```bash
https://api.wormholescan.io/api/v1/operations?address=INSERT_ADDRESS
```

Simply replace `INSERT_ADDRESS_HERE` with the address you want to query. The API will return a list of operations, including details about previously bridged transactions.

???- example "Fetch transaction history for a specific address"
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.wormholescan.io/api/v1/operations?address=0x05c009C4C1F1983d4B915C145F4E782de23d3A38" -H "accept: application/json"
    ```

## How can I manually submit a VAA to a destination chain in the correct format?

To manually submit a VAA (Verifiable Action Approval) to a destination chain, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain the VAA in Base64 format** - navigate to the **Advanced** tab in [Wormholescan](https://wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank} to find the VAA associated with the transaction you want to submit and copy the VAA in base64 format

    ```bash
    https://wormholescan.io/#/tx/INSERT_TX_HASH?view=advanced
    ```

2. **Convert the VAA to hex** - you must convert the base64 VAA into a hexadecimal (hex) format before submitting it to the destination chain. This can be done using various online tools or via command-line utilities like `xxd` or a script in a language like Python

3. **Submit the VAA through Etherscan (for EVM chains)** - once the VAA is in hex format, go to the [Etherscan UI](https://etherscan.io/){target=\_blank} and submit it through the [`TokenBridge`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/interfaces/ITokenBridge.sol){target=\_blank} contract’s method (such as the `CompleteTransfer` function or `CompleteTransferWithPayload`)

    - The `TokenBridge` contract addresses for each chain are available in the [Wormhole contract addresses](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/){target=\_blank} section

    - Interact with the smart contract through the Etherscan UI by pasting the hex-encoded VAA into the appropriate field

Following these steps, you can manually submit a VAA in the proper format to a destination chain.

# Solidity SDK

## Introduction 

The [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank} simplifies cross-chain messaging on EVM-compatible chains by providing essential Solidity interfaces, utility libraries, and testing tools. It allows developers to build secure and efficient cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps) without manually interacting with Wormhole’s core contracts across multiple chains.

By abstracting away complex interactions, the SDK drastically reduces the overhead associated with cross-chain development. It provides:

 - **Unified interfaces** - developers can use a standardized set of Solidity interfaces to handle cross-chain messaging, token transfers, and verifiable action approvals (VAAs) without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure
 - **Automated message delivery** - the SDK leverages Wormhole’s relayer infrastructure, automatically delivering messages across chains, reducing the need for manual intervention, and simplifying gas management on the target chain
 - **Seamless integration with Wormhole services** - the SDK integrates with Wormhole’s `TokenBridge` and Circle’s CCTP, providing built-in mechanisms for cross-chain asset transfers, making token bridges and cross-chain messaging easy to implement
 - **Testing and development tools** - it comes with comprehensive tools for local testing and simulation, allowing developers to validate their cross-chain logic before deployment, minimizing the risk of errors in production environments

These features significantly streamline the development workflow by reducing complexity and offering tools compatible with various EVM versions. This helps developers avoid issues that arise from differences in EVM equivalence across chains.

This guide covers installation, key concepts, and usage examples to help you build secure cross-chain applications using the SDK, from token transfers to advanced message passing.

## Installation

To install the SDK, use [Foundry and Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank}. This pulls the necessary libraries into your project:

```bash
forge install wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk@v0.1.0
```

When developing cross-chain applications, ensure that the chains you target support the EVM version you’re using. For instance, the PUSH0 opcode (introduced in Solidity 0.8.20) may not be available on all chains. To avoid compatibility issues, you can set the EVM version in your `foundry.toml` file:

```toml
evm_version = "paris"
```

This ensures compatibility across all targeted chains, even if some do not yet support the latest EVM upgrades.

## Key Considerations

Before deploying applications using the Wormhole Solidity SDK, keep these considerations in mind:

 - **Version compatibility** - the SDK is evolving, and using tagged releases for production is crucial, as the main branch may introduce breaking changes
 - **IERC-20 remapping** - the SDK provides a remapping mechanism to handle potential conflicts between different implementations of IERC20, ensuring seamless integration with other libraries
 - **Testing** - given the cross-chain dependencies, testing all integrations is critical to avoid issues in production environments

## Concepts and Components

The Wormhole Solidity SDK consists of key components that streamline cross-chain communication, allowing developers to securely and efficiently interact with Wormhole’s infrastructure. Below are the critical concepts and contracts you'll encounter when working with the SDK.

### Cross-Chain Messaging with the Wormhole Relayer SDK

The [`WormholeRelayerSDK.sol`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol){target=\_blank} contract simplifies cross-chain messaging and asset transfers by integrating several necessary modules, including the Wormhole relayer. By automating message delivery between chains, the Wormhole relayer removes the need for developers to manage relayer infrastructure or handle gas on the target chain. Delivery providers handle the message payload, ensuring secure and efficient communication.

You can refer to the [Wormhole relayer documentation](/docs/build/core-messaging/wormhole-relayers/){target=\_blank} for more details.

Key modules in the SDK include:

 - **`Base.sol`** - the core module for cross-chain messaging. It provides utility functions like `onlyWormholeRelayer()` and `setRegisteredSender()`, ensuring that only messages from trusted relayers are processed

 - **`TokenBase.sol`** - this module extends the base messaging functionality to support cross-chain token transfers. It includes utilities for securely sending and receiving tokens between EVM-compatible chains

 - **`CCTPBase.sol`** - designed for Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol, this module manages asset transfers such as USDC between chains. It includes functionalities for both sending and receiving CCTP-based assets

 - **`CCTPAndTokenBase.sol`** - a combined module that supports token and CCTP-based asset transfers in a single implementation. This module simplifies development for applications needing to handle both types of transfers

The Wormhole Solidity SDK offers a unified framework for cross-chain communication. Developers can select specific modules based on their application’s requirements, whether for messaging, token transfers, or CCTP. Each module includes built-in security measures, ensuring that only authorized senders or relayers are accepted, thereby protecting the application from unauthorized interactions.

Please refer to the complete `WormholeRelayerSDK.sol` file below for further details.

    ```

### Base Contract Overview

The [`Base.sol`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/WormholeRelayer/Base.sol){target=\_blank} contract is a core part of the Wormhole Solidity SDK, providing essential helper functions and modifiers for managing cross-chain messages securely via the Wormhole Relayer. It handles sender registration and message validation, ensuring only authorized senders from specific chains can send messages.

 - **`onlyWormholeRelayer()`** - a modifier that ensures only authorized messages from the Wormhole relayer contract are processed, restricting access to certain functions

    ```solidity
    require(
            msg.sender == address(wormholeRelayer),
            "Msg.sender is not Wormhole Relayer"
        );
        _;
    }
    ```

 - **`setRegisteredSender()`** - restricts message acceptance to a registered sender from a specific chain, ensuring messages are only processed from trusted sources

    ```solidity
    uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32 sourceAddress
    ) public {
        require(
            msg.sender == registrationOwner,
            "Not allowed to set registered sender"
        );
        registeredSenders[sourceChain] = sourceAddress;
    }
    ```

These security measures ensure messages come from the correct source and are processed securely. Please refer to the complete `Base.sol` contract below for further details.

     * Sender is the address that called 'send' on the Wormhole Relayer contract on the source chain)
     */
    function setRegisteredSender(
        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32 sourceAddress
    ) public {
        require(
            msg.sender == registrationOwner,
            "Not allowed to set registered sender"
        );
        registeredSenders[sourceChain] = sourceAddress;
    }
}
    ```

### Interface for Cross-Chain Messages

The Wormhole Solidity SDK interacts with the Wormhole relayer for sending and receiving messages across EVM-compatible chains. The [`IWormholeRelayer`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/interfaces/IWormholeRelayer.sol){target=\_blank} and [`IWormholeReceiver`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/interfaces/IWormholeReceiver.sol){target=\_blank} interfaces are central to cross-chain communication, enabling secure and efficient message delivery.

For detailed information on how to implement these interfaces, refer to the [Wormhole Relayer Interfaces documentation](/docs/build/core-messaging/wormhole-relayers/#wormhole-relayer-interfaces){target=\_blank}. This section covers:

 - **`IWormholeRelayer`** – methods for sending cross-chain messages, VAAs, and token transfers
 - **`IWormholeReceiver`** – the required implementation for receiving cross-chain messages
 - **`quoteEVMDeliveryPrice()`** – how to estimate gas and fees for cross-chain transactions

These interfaces reduce the complexity of cross-chain dApp development by abstracting away the details of relayer infrastructure, ensuring that message delivery is handled efficiently.

### Advanced Concepts

For developers interested in exploring additional advanced topics, the following sections provide insights into key aspects of the SDK’s functionality.

???- note "Error Handling and Reverts"
    The SDK defines several custom errors to help developers handle common issues like incorrect gas fees, invalid senders, and more. For example, `InvalidMsgValue` is thrown when the message value for a relayed message is erroneous.

    ```solidity
    error InvalidMsgValue(uint256 msgValue, uint256 totalFee);
    ```

## Usage

This section covers cross-chain messaging and token transfers and shows how to use the Wormhole Solidity SDK in real-world scenarios.

### Send a Cross-Chain Message

To send a cross-chain message, inherit from the base contract provided by the SDK and use its helper methods to define your message and sender address. Here’s a basic example:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/WormholeRelayer/Base.sol";

contract CrossChainSender is Base {
    constructor(
        address _wormholeRelayer,
        address _wormhole
    ) Base(_wormholeRelayer, _wormhole) {}

    function sendMessage(
        bytes memory message,
        uint16 targetChain,
        bytes32 targetAddress
    ) external payable {
        // Register sender and send message through WormholeRelayer
        setRegisteredSender(targetChain, msg.sender);
        onlyWormholeRelayer().sendPayloadToEvm(
            targetChain,
            address(targetAddress),
            message,
            0,
            500_000
        );
    }
}
```

This contract extends `Base.sol` and allows sending cross-chain messages securely using the `WormholeRelayer`.

### Send Tokens Across Chains

The SDK enables seamless token transfers between EVM-compatible chains in addition to sending messages. To facilitate cross-chain token transfers, you can extend the SDK's `TokenSender` and `TokenReceiver` base contracts.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/WormholeRelayer/TokenBase.sol";

contract CrossChainTokenSender is TokenSender {
    constructor(
        address _wormholeRelayer,
        address _wormhole
    ) TokenSender(_wormholeRelayer, _wormhole) {}

    function sendToken(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint16 targetChain,
        bytes32 targetAddress
    ) external payable {
        // Send tokens across chains
        transferTokenToTarget(token, amount, targetChain, targetAddress);
    }
}
```

In this example, `TokenSender` initiates a token transfer to another chain. The SDK’s built-in utilities securely handle token transfers, ensuring proper VAAs are generated and processed.

### Receive Tokens Across Chains

To receive tokens on the target chain, implement a contract that inherits from `TokenReceiver` and overrides the `receiveWormholeMessages` function.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/WormholeRelayer/TokenBase.sol";

contract CrossChainTokenReceiver is TokenReceiver {
    constructor(
        address _wormholeRelayer,
        address _wormhole
    ) TokenReceiver(_wormholeRelayer, _wormhole) {}

    // Function to handle received tokens from another chain
    function receiveWormholeMessages(
        bytes memory payload,
        bytes[] memory additionalMessages,
        bytes32 sourceAddress,
        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32 deliveryHash
    ) external payable override {
        // Process the received tokens here
        receiveTokens(payload);
    }
}
```

In this example, `TokenReceiver` allows the contract to handle tokens sent from the source chain. Once the cross-chain message is received, the `receiveWormholeMessages` function processes the incoming tokens. Always validate the message's authenticity and source.

!!! note
    Always verify the source of incoming messages and tokens to prevent unauthorized access to your contract. Please refer to the [Emitter Verification](/docs/build/core-messaging/core-contracts/#validating-the-emitter/){target=\_blank} section for more details.

## Testing Environment

The SDK includes built-in support for Forge-based testing, which allows you to test your cross-chain applications locally before deploying them to production. Testing with the same Solidity compiler version and configuration you plan to use in production is highly recommended to catch any potential issues early.

# Building Protocols and Payloads

## Introduction

The [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank} provides a flexible and powerful system for integrating cross-chain communication into your applications. A key feature of the SDK is its ability to define protocols—modular units representing distinct functionalities—and their associated payloads, which encapsulate the data required for specific operations within those protocols.

This guide will help you understand how to build protocols and payloads in the SDK, covering:

 - The role of protocols and payloads in cross-chain communication
 - The mechanics of registering protocols and payloads using the SDK
 - Best practices for creating strongly typed layouts to ensure compatibility and reliability
 - Real-world examples using the `TokenBridge` as a reference implementation

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to define, register, and use protocols and payloads in your projects.

## What is a Protocol?

In the Wormhole SDK, a protocol represents a significant feature or functionality that operates across multiple blockchains. Protocols provide the framework for handling specific types of messages, transactions, or operations consistently and standardized.

Examples of Protocols:

 - **`TokenBridge`** - enables cross-chain token transfers, including operations like transferring tokens and relaying payloads
 - **`NTT (Native Token Transfers)`** - manages native token movements across chains

Protocols are defined by:

 - **A `name`** - a string identifier (e.g., `TokenBridge`, `Ntt`)
 - **A set of `payloads`** - these represent the specific actions or messages supported by the protocol, such as `Transfer` or `TransferWithPayload`

Each protocol is registered in the Wormhole SDK, allowing developers to leverage its predefined features or extend it with custom payloads.

## What is a Payload?

A payload is a structured piece of data that encapsulates the details of a specific operation within a protocol. It defines the format, fields, and types of data used in a message or transaction. Payloads ensure consistency and type safety when handling complex cross-chain operations.

Each payload is defined as:

 - **A `layout`** - describes the binary format of the payload fields
 - **A `literal`** - combines the protocol name and payload name into a unique identifier (e.g., `TokenBridge:Transfer`)

By registering payloads, developers can enforce type safety and enable serialization and deserialization for specific protocol operations.

## Register Protocols and Payloads

Protocols and payloads work together to enable cross-chain communication with precise type safety. For instance, in the `TokenBridge` protocol:

 - The protocol is registered under the `TokenBridge` namespace
 - Payloads like `Transfer` or `AttestMeta` are linked to the protocol to handle specific operations

Understanding the connection between these components is important for customizing or extending the SDK to suit your needs.

### Register Protocols

Registering a protocol establishes its connection to Wormhole's infrastructure, ensuring it interacts seamlessly with payloads and platforms while maintaining type safety and consistency.

#### How Protocol Registration Works

Protocol registration involves two key tasks:

 - **Mapping protocols to interfaces** - connect the protocol to its corresponding interface, defining its expected behavior across networks (`N`) and chains (`C`). This ensures type safety, similar to strong typing, by preventing runtime errors if protocol definitions are incorrect
 - **Linking protocols to platforms** - specify platform-specific implementations if needed, or use default mappings for platform-agnostic protocols

For example, here's the `TokenBridge` protocol registration:

```typescript
declare module '../../registry.js' {
  export namespace WormholeRegistry {
    interface ProtocolToInterfaceMapping<N, C> {
      TokenBridge: TokenBridge<N, C>;
    }
    interface ProtocolToPlatformMapping {
      TokenBridge: EmptyPlatformMap<'TokenBridge'>;
    }
  }
}
```

This code snippet:

 - Maps the `TokenBridge` protocol to its interface to define how it operates
 - Links the protocol to a default platform mapping via `EmptyPlatformMap`

You can view the full implementation in the [`TokenBridge` protocol file](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/protocols/tokenBridge/tokenBridge.ts#L14-L70){target=\_blank}.

#### Platform-Specific Protocols

Some protocols require platform-specific behavior. For instance, the EVM-compatible Wormhole Registry maps native addresses for Ethereum-based chains:

```typescript
declare module '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-connect' {
  export namespace WormholeRegistry {
    interface PlatformToNativeAddressMapping {
      Evm: EvmAddress;
    }
  }
}

registerNative(_platform, EvmAddress);
```

This ensures that `EvmAddress` is registered as the native address type for EVM-compatible platforms. See the [EVM platform address file](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/platforms/evm/src/address.ts#L98-L106){target=\_blank} for details.

### Register Payloads

[Payload registration](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/dbbbc7c365db602dd3b534f6d615ac80c3d2aaf1/core/definitions/src/vaa/registration.ts){target=\_blank} enables developers to define, serialize, and handle custom message types within their protocols. It establishes the connection between a protocol and its payloads, ensuring seamless integration, type enforcement, and runtime efficiency.

This process ties a protocol to its payloads using a combination of:

 - **Payload literals** - unique identifiers in the format `<ProtocolName>:<PayloadName>`. These literals map each payload to a layout
 - **Payload layouts** - structures that define the binary representation of payload data
 - **The payload factory** - a centralized runtime registry that maps payload literals to layouts for dynamic resolution and serialization

These components work together to streamline the definition and management of protocol payloads.

#### How Payload Registration Works

Payload registration involves:

1. **Define payload layouts** - create layouts to structure your payloads. For instance, a protocol might use a `TransferWithPayload` layout:

    ```typescript
    export const transferWithPayloadLayout = <
  const P extends CustomizableBytes = undefined
>(
  customPayload?: P
) =>
  [
    payloadIdItem(3),
    ...transferCommonLayout,
    { name: 'from', ...universalAddressItem },
    customizableBytes({ name: 'payload' }, customPayload),
  ] as const;
    ```

2. **Register payloads** - use `registerPayloadTypes` to map payload literals to their layouts:

    ```typescript
    registerPayloadTypes('ProtocolName', protocolNamedPayloads);
    ```

3. **Access registered payloads** - use the [`getPayloadLayout`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/9105de290c91babbf8ad031bd89cc75ee38739c8/core/definitions/src/vaa/functions.ts#L19-L23){target=\_blank} function to fetch the layout for a specific payload literal. This method ensures that the correct layout is retrieved dynamically and safely:

    ```typescript
    const layout = getPayloadLayout('ProtocolName:PayloadName');
    ```

These steps link payload literals and their layouts, enabling seamless runtime handling.

#### The Payload Factory

At the core of the payload registration process is the `payloadFactory`, a registry that manages the mapping between payload literals and layouts:

```typescript
export const payloadFactory = new Map<LayoutLiteral, Layout>();

export function registerPayloadType(
  protocol: ProtocolName,
  name: string,
  layout: Layout
) {
  const payloadLiteral = composeLiteral(protocol, name);
  if (payloadFactory.has(payloadLiteral)) {
    throw new Error(`Payload type ${payloadLiteral} already registered`);
  }
  payloadFactory.set(payloadLiteral, layout);
}
```

 - The `payloadFactory` ensures each payload literal maps to its layout uniquely
 - The [`registerPayloadType`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/dbbbc7c365db602dd3b534f6d615ac80c3d2aaf1/core/definitions/src/vaa/registration.ts#L46-L52){target=\_blank} function adds individual payloads, while [`registerPayloadTypes`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/dbbbc7c365db602dd3b534f6d615ac80c3d2aaf1/core/definitions/src/vaa/registration.ts#L62-L64){target=\_blank} supports bulk registration

This implementation ensures dynamic, efficient handling of payloads at runtime.

## Integrate Protocols with Payloads

Integrating payloads with protocols enables dynamic identification through payload literals, while serialization and deserialization ensure their binary representation is compatible across chains. For more details on these processes, refer to the [Layouts page](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/sdk-layout/){target=\_blank}.

### Payload Discriminators

Payload discriminators are mechanisms in the Wormhole SDK that dynamically identify and map incoming payloads to their respective layouts at runtime. They are relevant for protocols like `TokenBridge`, enabling efficient handling of diverse payload types while ensuring type safety and consistent integration.

#### How Discriminators Work

Discriminators evaluate serialized binary data and determine the corresponding payload layout by inspecting fixed fields or patterns within the data. Each payload layout is associated with a payload literal (e.g., `TokenBridge:Transfer` or `TokenBridge:TransferWithPayload`).

This system ensures:

 - **Dynamic runtime identification** - payloads are parsed based on their content, even if a single protocol handles multiple payload types
 - **Strict type enforcement** - discriminators leverage layout mappings to prevent invalid payloads from being processed

Below is an example of how the Wormhole SDK builds a discriminator to distinguish between payload layouts:

```typescript
export function layoutDiscriminator<B extends boolean = false>(
  layouts: readonly Layout[],
  allowAmbiguous?: B
): Discriminator<B> {
  // Internal logic to determine distinguishable layouts
  const [distinguishable, discriminator] = internalBuildDiscriminator(layouts);
  if (!distinguishable && !allowAmbiguous) {
    throw new Error('Cannot uniquely distinguish the given layouts');
  }

  return (
    !allowAmbiguous
      ? (encoded: BytesType) => {
          const layout = discriminator(encoded);
          return layout.length === 0 ? null : layout[0];
        }
      : discriminator
  ) as Discriminator<B>;
}
```

 - [`layoutDiscriminator`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/9105de290c91babbf8ad031bd89cc75ee38739c8/core/base/src/utils/layout.ts#L16){target=\_blank} takes a list of layouts and generates a function that can identify the appropriate layout for a given serialized payload
 - The `allowAmbiguous` parameter determines whether layouts with overlapping characteristics are permitted

### Real-World Example: Token Bridge Protocol

Integrating protocols with their respective payloads exemplifies how the Wormhole SDK leverages layouts and type-safe registration mechanisms to ensure efficient cross-chain communication. This section focuses on how protocols like `TokenBridge` use payloads to facilitate specific operations.

#### Token Bridge Protocol and Payloads

The `TokenBridge` protocol enables cross-chain token transfers through its payloads. Key payloads include:

 - **`Transfer`** - handles basic token transfer operations
 - **`TransferWithPayload`** - extends the `Transfer` payload to include custom data, enhancing functionality

Payloads are registered to the `TokenBridge` protocol via the `PayloadLiteralToLayoutMapping` interface, which links payload literals (e.g., `TokenBridge:Transfer`) to their layouts.

Additionally, the protocol uses reusable layouts like [`transferCommonLayout`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/76b20317b0f68e823d4e6c4a2e41bb2a7705c64f/core/definitions/src/protocols/tokenBridge/tokenBridgeLayout.ts#L29C7-L47){target=\_blank} and extends them in more specialized layouts such as [`transferWithPayloadLayout`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/76b20317b0f68e823d4e6c4a2e41bb2a7705c64f/core/definitions/src/protocols/tokenBridge/tokenBridgeLayout.ts#L49-L57){target=\_blank}:

```typescript
export const transferWithPayloadLayout = <
  const P extends CustomizableBytes = undefined
>(
  customPayload?: P
) =>
  [
    payloadIdItem(3),
    ...transferCommonLayout,
    { name: 'from', ...universalAddressItem },
    customizableBytes({ name: 'payload' }, customPayload),
  ] as const;
```

This layout includes:

 - A `payloadIdItem` to identify the payload type
 - Common fields for token and recipient details
 - A customizable `payload` field for additional data

#### Use the Discriminator

To manage multiple payloads, the `TokenBridge` protocol utilizes a discriminator to distinguish between payload types dynamically. For example:

```typescript
const tokenBridgePayloads = ['Transfer', 'TransferWithPayload'] as const;

export const getTransferDiscriminator = lazyInstantiate(() =>
  payloadDiscriminator([_protocol, tokenBridgePayloads])
);
```

 - The [`getTransferDiscriminator`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/dbbbc7c365db602dd3b534f6d615ac80c3d2aaf1/core/definitions/src/protocols/tokenBridge/tokenBridge.ts#L67-L70){target=\_blank} function dynamically evaluates payloads using predefined layouts
 - This ensures that each payload type is processed according to its unique structure and type-safe layout

#### Register Payloads to Protocols

Here’s how the `TokenBridge` protocol connects its payloads to the Wormhole SDK:

```typescript
declare module '../../registry.js' {
  export namespace WormholeRegistry {
    interface PayloadLiteralToLayoutMapping
      extends RegisterPayloadTypes<
        'TokenBridge',
        typeof tokenBridgeNamedPayloads
      > {}
  }
}

registerPayloadTypes('TokenBridge', tokenBridgeNamedPayloads);
```

This registration links the `TokenBridge` payload literals to their respective layouts, enabling serialization and deserialization at runtime.

You can explore the complete `TokenBridge` protocol and payload definitions in the [`TokenBridge` layout file](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/protocols/tokenBridge/tokenBridgeLayout.ts){target=\_blank}.

#### Token Bridge Payloads

The following payloads are registered for the `TokenBridge` protocol:

 - **`AttestMeta`** - used for token metadata attestation
 - **`Transfer`** - facilitates token transfers
 - **`TransferWithPayload`** - adds a custom payload to token transfers

These payloads and their layouts are defined in the [`TokenBridge` layout file](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/protocols/tokenBridge/tokenBridgeLayout.ts){target=\_blank}.

### Other Protocols: Native Token Transfers (NTT)

While this guide focuses on the `TokenBridge` protocol, other protocols, like NTT, follow a similar structure.

 - NTT manages the transfer of native tokens across chains
 - Payloads such as `WormholeTransfer` and `WormholeTransferStandardRelayer` are registered to the protocol using the same patterns for payload literals and layouts
 - The same mechanisms for type-safe registration and payload discriminators apply, ensuring reliability and extensibility

For more details, you can explore the [NTT implementation in the SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/00f83aa215338b1b8fd66f522bd0f45be3e98a5a/sdk/definitions/src/ntt.ts){target=\_blank}.

# Data Layouts

## Introduction

The [Wormhole SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank} uses the [layout package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binary-layout){target=\_blank} to define, serialize, and deserialize data structures efficiently. This modular system ensures consistent data formatting and cross-environment compatibility, benefiting projects that require robust handling of structured data.

By understanding the layout mechanism, you’ll be able to:

 - Define data structures (numbers, arrays, and custom types)
 - Efficiently serialize and deserialize data using the SDK’s utilities
 - Handle protocol-specific layouts with ease

This guide is beneficial for developers looking to integrate Wormhole into their applications or protocols, especially those dealing with complex payloads or cross-chain communication.

## Key Concepts

### Layout Items

A layout defines how data structures should be serialized (converted into binary format) and deserialized (converted back into their original structure). This ensures consistent data formatting when transmitting information across different blockchain environments.

Layouts are composed of [layout items](https://github.com/nonergodic/layout/blob/main/src/items.ts){target=\_blank}, which describe individual fields or sets of fields in your data. Each layout item specifies:

 - **`name`** - name of the field
 - **`binary`** - type of data (e.g., `uint`, `bytes`)
 - **`size`** - byte length for fixed-size fields within uint and bytes items only

Layout items can represent:

 - **Primitive types** - basic data types like unsigned integers (`uint`) or byte arrays (`bytes`)
 - **Composite types** - more complex structures, such as arrays or nested objects

Below is an example of a layout that might be used to serialize a message across the Wormhole protocol:

```typescript
const exampleLayout = [
  { name: 'sourceChain', binary: 'uint', size: 2 },
  { name: 'orderSender', binary: 'bytes', size: 32 },
  { name: 'redeemer', binary: 'bytes', size: 32 },
  { name: 'redeemerMessage', binary: 'bytes', lengthSize: 4 },
] as const;
```

In this example:

 - `sourceChain` is a 2-byte unsigned integer (`uint`) identifying the source blockchain
 - `orderSender` is a fixed-length 32-byte array representing the sender's address
 - `redeemer` is another 32-byte array used for the redeemer’s address
 - `redeemerMessage` is a variable-length byte sequence, with its length specified by a 4-byte integer

This layout definition ensures that all necessary data fields are consistently encoded and can be correctly interpreted when they are deserialized.

### Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization converts structured data into binary format; deserialization reverses this, reconstructing the original objects.

You can serialize data using the `serializeLayout` function:

```typescript
const serialized = serializeLayout(fillLayout, exampleFill);
```

To deserialize the binary data back into a structured object, use the `deserializeLayout` function:

```typescript
const deserialized = deserializeLayout(fillLayout, serialized);
```

### Custom Conversions

Layouts also allow for custom conversions, which help map complex or custom types (like chain IDs or universal addresses) into a more usable format. This is useful when serializing or deserializing data that doesn’t fit neatly into simple types like integers or byte arrays.

For example, consider a custom conversion for a chain ID:

```typescript
const chainCustomConversion = {
  to: (chainId: number) => toChain(chainId),
  from: (chain: Chain) => chainToChainId(chain),
} satisfies CustomConversion<number, Chain>;
```

This setup allows Wormhole to convert between human-readable formats and binary-encoded data used in payloads.

### Error Handling

The layout system performs error checks during serialization and deserialization. An error is thrown if data is incorrectly sized or in the wrong format. Refer to the below example:

```typescript
try {
  deserializeLayout(fillLayout, corruptedData);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error during deserialization:', error.message);
}
```

## Application of Layouts

This section will focus on applying the concepts explained earlier through examples. These will help developers better understand how to define layouts, serialize and deserialize data, and use custom conversions where needed.

### Defining Layouts

To get started with layouts in Wormhole, you need to define your structure. A layout is simply a list of fields (layout items) describing how each data piece will be serialized.

Consider the following layout for a payload:

```typescript
const exampleLayout = [
  { name: 'sourceChain', binary: 'uint', size: 2 },
  { name: 'orderSender', binary: 'bytes', size: 32 },
  { name: 'redeemer', binary: 'bytes', size: 32 },
  { name: 'redeemerMessage', binary: 'bytes', lengthSize: 4 },
] as const;
```

In this example:

 - `sourceChain` is an unsigned integer (uint) of 2 bytes
 - `orderSender` is a 32-byte fixed-length byte array
 - `redeemer` is another 32-byte byte array
 - `redeemerMessage` is a length-prefixed byte array, with the length specified by a 4-byte integer

### Serialize Data

Once a layout is defined, the next step is to serialize data according to that structure. You can accomplish this using the `serializeLayout` function from the Wormhole SDK.

```typescript
const examplePayload = {
  sourceChain: 6,
  orderSender: new Uint8Array(32),
  redeemer: new Uint8Array(32),
  redeemerMessage: new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]),
};

const serializedData = serializeLayout(exampleLayout, examplePayload);
```

This takes the data structure (`examplePayload`) and serializes it according to the rules defined in the layout (`exampleLayout`). The result is a `Uint8Array` representing the serialized binary data.

### Deserialize Data

Deserialization is the reverse of serialization. Given a serialized `Uint8Array`, we can convert it back into its original structure using the `deserializeLayout` function.

```typescript
const deserializedPayload = deserializeLayout(exampleLayout, serializedData);
```

This will output the structured object, making it easy to work with data transmitted or received from another chain.

### Handling Variable-Length Fields

One relevant aspect of Wormhole SDK's layout system is the ability to handle variable-length fields, such as arrays and length-prefixed byte sequences.

For instance, if you want to serialize or deserialize a message where the length of the content isn't known beforehand, you can define a layout item with a `lengthSize` field.

```typescript
{ name: 'message', binary: 'bytes', lengthSize: 4 }
```

This tells the SDK to read or write the message's length (in 4 bytes) and then handle the content.

## Nested Layouts and Strong Typing

The Wormhole SDK simplifies handling complex structures with nested layouts and strong typing. Nested layouts clearly represent hierarchical data, while strong typing ensures data consistency and catches errors during development.

### Nested Layout

In complex protocols, layouts can contain nested structures. Nested layouts become relevant here, allowing you to represent hierarchical data (such as transactions or multi-part messages) in a structured format.

Refer to the following nested layout where a message contains nested fields:

```typescript
const nestedLayout = [
  {
    name: 'source',
    binary: 'bytes',
    layout: [
      { name: 'chainId', binary: 'uint', size: 2 },
      { name: 'sender', binary: 'bytes', size: 32 },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: 'redeemer',
    binary: 'bytes',
    layout: [
      { name: 'address', binary: 'bytes', size: 32 },
      { name: 'message', binary: 'bytes', lengthSize: 4 },
    ],
  },
] as const satisfies Layout;
```

In this layout:

 - `source` is an object with two fields: `chainId` and `sender`
 - `redeemer` is another object with two fields: `address` and a length-prefixed `message`

### Strong Typing

One of the benefits of using the Wormhole SDK in TypeScript is its support for strong typing. This ensures that serialized and deserialized data conform to expected structures, reducing errors during development by enforcing type checks at compile time.

Using TypeScript, the `LayoutToType` utility provided by the SDK automatically generates a strongly typed structure based on the layout:

```typescript
type NestedMessage = LayoutToType<typeof nestedLayout>;
```

This ensures that when you serialize or deserialize data, it matches the expected structure.

```typescript
const message: NestedMessage = {
  source: {
    chainId: 6,
    sender: new Uint8Array(32),
  },
  redeemer: {
    address: new Uint8Array(32),
    message: new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]),
  },
};
```

Attempting to assign data of incorrect types will result in a compile-time error. The Wormhole SDK's layout system enforces strong types, reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability.

### Serialization and Deserialization with Nested Layouts

You can serialize and deserialize nested structures in the same way as simpler layouts:

```typescript
const serializedNested = serializeLayout(nestedLayout, message);
const deserializedNested = deserializeLayout(nestedLayout, serializedNested);
```

Strong typing in TypeScript ensures that the message object conforms to the nested layout structure. This reduces the risk of data inconsistency during cross-chain communication.

## Commonly Used Layouts

The Wormhole SDK includes predefined layouts frequently used in cross-chain messaging. These layouts are optimized for standard fields such as chain IDs, addresses, and signatures. You can explore the complete set of predefined layouts in the [`layout-items` directory](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/tree/main/core/definitions/src/layout-items){target=\_blank} of the Wormhole SDK.

### Chain ID Layouts

Chain ID layouts in the Wormhole SDK derive from a common foundation: `chainItemBase`. This structure defines the binary representation of a chain ID as a 2-byte unsigned integer, ensuring consistency across serialization and deserialization processes.

#### Base Structure

This simple structure is the blueprint for more specific layouts by standardizing the binary format and size.

```typescript
const chainItemBase = { binary: 'uint', size: 2 } as const;
```

#### Dynamic Chain ID Layout

The dynamic chain ID layout, [`chainItem`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/layout-items/chain.ts#L13-L40){target=\_blank}, extends `chainItemBase` by adding flexible custom conversion logic. It enables runtime validation of chain IDs, supports optional null values, and restricts chain IDs to a predefined set when needed.

```typescript
export const chainItem = <
  const C extends readonly Chain[] = typeof chains,
  const N extends boolean = false,
>(opts?: {
  allowedChains?: C;
  allowNull?: N;
}) =>
  ({
    ...chainItemBase, // Builds on the base structure
    custom: {
      to: (val: number): AllowNull<C[number], N> => { ... },
      from: (val: AllowNull<C[number], N>): number => { ... },
    },
  });
```

This layout is versatile. It allows the serialization of human-readable chain names (e.g., `Ethereum`) to numeric IDs (e.g., `1`) and vice versa. This is particularly useful when working with dynamic configurations or protocols supporting multiple chains.

#### Fixed Chain ID Layout

The fixed chain ID layout, [`fixedChainItem`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/layout-items/chain.ts#L42-L49){target=\_blank}, is more rigid. It also extends `chainItemBase`, but the custom field is hardcoded for a single chain. This eliminates runtime validation and enforces strict adherence to a specific chain.

```typescript
export const fixedChainItem = <const C extends Chain>(chain: C) => ({
  ...chainItemBase, // Builds on the base structure
  custom: {
    to: chain,
    from: chainToChainId(chain),
  },
});
```

This layout allows developers to efficiently serialize and deserialize messages involving a single, fixed chain ID.

### Address Layout

The Wormhole SDK uses a Universal Address Layout to serialize and deserialize blockchain addresses into a standardized format. This layout ensures that addresses are always represented as fixed 32-byte binary values, enabling seamless cross-chain communication.

#### Base Structure

The [`universalAddressItem`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/layout-items/universalAddress.ts#L7-L14){target=\_blank} defines the layout for addresses. It uses the binary type bytes and enforces a fixed size of 32 bytes for consistency.

```typescript
export const universalAddressItem = {
  binary: 'bytes',
  size: 32,
  custom: {
    to: (val: Uint8Array): UniversalAddress => new UniversalAddress(val),
    from: (val: UniversalAddress): Uint8Array => val.toUint8Array(),
  } satisfies CustomConversion<Uint8Array, UniversalAddress>,
} as const satisfies LayoutItem;
```

This layout ensures consistent address handling by defining the following:

 - **Serialization** - converts a high-level `UniversalAddress` object into raw binary (32 bytes) for efficient storage or transmission
 - **Deserialization** - converts raw binary back into a `UniversalAddress` object, enabling further interaction in a human-readable or programmatic format

### Signature Layout

In the Wormhole SDK, the Signature Layout defines how to serialize and deserialize cryptographic signatures. These signatures verify message authenticity and ensure data integrity, particularly in Guardian-signed VAAs.

#### Base Structure

The `signatureLayout` specifies the binary structure of a secp256k1 signature. It divides the signature into three components:

```typescript
const signatureLayout = [
  { name: 'r', binary: 'uint', size: 32 },
  { name: 's', binary: 'uint', size: 32 },
  { name: 'v', binary: 'uint', size: 1 },
] as const satisfies Layout;
```

This layout provides a clear binary format for the secp256k1 signature, making it efficient to process within the Wormhole protocol.

#### Layout with Custom Conversion

The [`signatureItem`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/layout-items/signature.ts#L15-L22){target=\_blank} builds upon the `signatureLayout` by adding custom conversion logic. This conversion transforms raw binary data into a high-level `Signature` object and vice versa.

```typescript
export const signatureItem = {
  binary: 'bytes',
  layout: signatureLayout,
  custom: {
    to: (val: LayoutToType<typeof signatureLayout>) =>
      new Signature(val.r, val.s, val.v),
    from: (val: Signature) => ({ r: val.r, s: val.s, v: val.v }),
  } satisfies CustomConversion<LayoutToType<typeof signatureLayout>, Signature>,
} as const satisfies BytesLayoutItem;
```

The `custom` field ensures seamless integration of raw binary data with the `Signature` class, encapsulating signature-specific logic.

## Advanced Use Cases

The Wormhole SDK’s layout system is designed to handle various data structures and serialization needs. This section will explore more advanced use cases, such as handling conditional data structures, fixed conversions, and optimizing serialization performance.

???- code "Switch Statements for Conditional Layouts"

    In some cases, the structure of serialized data might change based on a specific field, such as a payload ID. The switch layout type conditionally defines layouts based on a value.

    For example, different message types can be identified using a payload ID, and the layout for each message can be determined at runtime:

    ```typescript
    const switchLayout = {
  binary: 'switch',
  idSize: 1, // size of the payload ID
  idTag: 'messageType', // tag to identify the type of message
  layouts: [
    [[1, 'messageType1'], fillLayout], // layout for type 1
    [[2, 'messageType2'], fastFillLayout], // layout for type 2
  ],
} as const satisfies Layout;
    ```

    The switch statement helps developers parse multiple payload types using the same structure, depending on a control field like an ID.

???- code "Fixed Conversions and Omitted Fields"

    Fixed conversions and omitted fields allow developers to handle known, static data without including it in every serialization or deserialization operation. For instance, when specific fields in a layout always hold a constant value, they can be omitted from the deserialized object.

    **Example: Fixed Conversion**

    In some cases, a field may always contain a predefined value. The layout system supports fixed conversions, allowing developers to “hard-code” these values:

    ```typescript
    const fixedConversionLayout = {
  binary: 'uint',
  size: 2,
  custom: {
    to: 'Ethereum',
    from: chainToChainId('Ethereum'),
  },
} as const satisfies Layout;
    ```

    **Example: Omitted Fields**

    Omitted fields are useful for handling padding or reserved fields that do not carry meaningful information and can safely be excluded from the deserialized output:

    ```typescript
    const omittedFieldLayout = [
  { name: 'reserved', binary: 'uint', size: 2, omit: true },
] as const satisfies Layout;
    ```

    In this example, `reserved` is a padding field with a fixed, non-dynamic value that serves no functional purpose. It is omitted from the deserialized result but still considered during serialization to maintain the correct binary format.

    Only fields with a fixed, known value, such as padding or reserved fields, should be marked as `omit: true`. Fields with meaningful or dynamic information, such as `sourceChain` or `version`, must remain in the deserialized structure to ensure data integrity and allow seamless round-trip conversions between serialized and deserialized representations.

## Integration with Wormhole Protocol

The layout system facilitates seamless interaction with the Wormhole protocol, mainly when dealing with VAAs. These cross-chain messages must be serialized and deserialized to ensure they can be transmitted and processed accurately across different chains.

### VAAs and Layouts

VAAs are the backbone of Wormhole’s cross-chain communication. Each VAA is a signed message encapsulating important information such as the originating chain, the emitter address, a sequence number, and Guardian signatures. The Wormhole SDK leverages its layout system to define, serialize, and deserialize VAAs, ensuring data integrity and chain compatibility.

#### Base VAA Structure

The Wormhole SDK organizes the VAA structure into three key components:

 - [**Header**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/vaa/vaa.ts#L37-L41){target=\_blank} - contains metadata such as the Guardian set index and an array of Guardian signatures
 - [**Envelope**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/vaa/vaa.ts#L44-L51){target=\_blank} - includes chain-specific details such as the emitter chain, address, sequence, and [consistency (finality) level](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank}
 - **Payload** - provides application-specific data, such as the actual message or operation being performed

**Header layout:**

```typescript
const guardianSignatureLayout = [
  { name: 'guardianIndex', binary: 'uint', size: 1 },
  { name: 'signature', ...signatureItem },
] as const satisfies Layout;

export const headerLayout = [
  { name: 'version', binary: 'uint', size: 1, custom: 1, omit: true },
  { name: 'guardianSet', ...guardianSetItem },
  {
    name: 'signatures',
    binary: 'array',
    lengthSize: 1,
    layout: guardianSignatureLayout,
  },
] as const satisfies Layout;
```

The header defines metadata for validating and processing the VAA, such as the Guardian set index and signatures. Each signature is represented using the `signatureItem` layout, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different platforms.

!!! note "Signature Standard Compliance"

    The signature field uses the `signatureItem` layout, which is explicitly defined as 65 bytes. This layout is aligned with widely used standards such as EIP-2612 and Uniswap's Permit2, ensuring compatibility with cryptographic protocols and applications.

**Envelope layout:**

```typescript
export const envelopeLayout = [
  { name: 'timestamp', binary: 'uint', size: 4 },
  { name: 'nonce', binary: 'uint', size: 4 },
  { name: 'emitterChain', ...chainItem() },
  { name: 'emitterAddress', ...universalAddressItem },
  { name: 'sequence', ...sequenceItem },
  { name: 'consistencyLevel', binary: 'uint', size: 1 },
] as const satisfies Layout;
```

The envelope encapsulates the VAA's core message data, including chain-specific information like the emitter address and sequence number. This structured layout ensures that the VAA can be securely transmitted across chains.

**Payload Layout:**

The Payload contains the user-defined data specific to the application or protocol, such as a token transfer message, governance action, or other cross-chain operation. The layout of the payload is dynamic and depends on the payload type, identified by the `payloadLiteral` field.

```typescript
const examplePayloadLayout = [
  { name: 'type', binary: 'uint', size: 1 },
  { name: 'data', binary: 'bytes', lengthSize: 2 },
] as const satisfies Layout;
```

This example demonstrates a payload containing:

 - A type field specifying the operation type (e.g., transfer or governance action)
 - A data field that is length-prefixed and can store operation-specific information

Dynamic payload layouts are selected at runtime using the `payloadLiteral` field, which maps to a predefined layout in the Wormhole SDK.

**Combined Base Layout:**

The base VAA layout combines the header, envelope, and dynamically selected payload layout:

```typescript
export const baseLayout = [...headerLayout, ...envelopeLayout] as const;
```

At runtime, the payload layout is appended to the `baseLayout` to form the complete structure.

#### Serializing VAA Data

The Wormhole SDK provides the [`serialize`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/vaa/functions.ts#L48-L54){target=\_blank} function to serialize a VAA message. This function combines the base layout (header and envelope) with the appropriate payload layout, ensuring the message’s format is correct for transmission across chains.

```typescript
import { serialize } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core/vaa/functions';

const vaaData = {
  guardianSet: 1,
  signatures: [{ guardianIndex: 0, signature: new Uint8Array(65).fill(0) }],
  timestamp: 1633000000,
  nonce: 42,
  emitterChain: 2, // Ethereum
  emitterAddress: new Uint8Array(32).fill(0),
  sequence: BigInt(1),
  consistencyLevel: 1,
  payloadLiteral: 'SomePayloadType',
  payload: { key: 'value' },
};

const serializedVAA = serialize(vaaData);
```

???- note "How does it work?"

    Internally, the serialize function dynamically combines the `baseLayout` (header and envelope) with the payload layout defined by the `payloadLiteral`. The complete layout is then passed to the `serializeLayout` function, which converts the data into binary format.

    ```typescript
    const layout = [
  ...baseLayout, // Header and envelope layout
  payloadLiteralToPayloadItemLayout(vaa.payloadLiteral), // Payload layout
] as const;

return serializeLayout(layout, vaa as LayoutToType<typeof layout>);
    ```

#### Deserializing VAA Data

The Wormhole SDK provides the [`deserialize`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/vaa/functions.ts#L162-L200){target=\_blank} function to parse a VAA from its binary format back into a structured object. This function uses the `baseLayout` and payload discriminator logic to ensure the VAA is correctly interpreted.

```typescript
import { deserialize } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core/vaa/functions';

const serializedVAA = new Uint8Array([
  /* Serialized VAA binary data */
]);

const vaaPayloadType = 'SomePayloadType'; // The payload type expected for this VAA
const deserializedVAA = deserialize(vaaPayloadType, serializedVAA);
```

???- note "How does it work?"

    Internally, the `deserialize` function uses the `baseLayout` (header and envelope) to parse the main VAA structure. It then identifies the appropriate payload layout using the provided payload type or discriminator.

    ```typescript
    const [header, envelopeOffset] = deserializeLayout(headerLayout, data, {
  consumeAll: false,
});

const [envelope, payloadOffset] = deserializeLayout(envelopeLayout, data, {
  offset: envelopeOffset,
  consumeAll: false,
});

const [payloadLiteral, payload] =
  typeof payloadDet === 'string'
    ? [
        payloadDet as PayloadLiteral,
        deserializePayload(payloadDet as PayloadLiteral, data, payloadOffset),
      ]
    : deserializePayload(
        payloadDet as PayloadDiscriminator,
        data,
        payloadOffset
      );

return {
  ...header,
  ...envelope,
  payloadLiteral,
  payload,
} satisfies VAA;
    ```

### Registering Custom Payloads

In the Wormhole SDK, payloads rely on layouts to define their binary structure, ensuring consistency and type safety across protocols. Custom payloads extend this functionality, allowing developers to handle protocol-specific features or unique use cases.

To learn how to define and register payloads using layouts, refer to the [Building Protocols and Payloads](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/protocols-payloads/){target=\_blank} page for a detailed guide.

## Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

When working with the Wormhole SDK layout system, it's important to be aware of a few common issues that can arise. Below are some pitfalls to avoid and best practices to ensure smooth integration.

### Pitfalls to Avoid

#### Defining Sizes for Data Types

When defining sizes for each data type, make sure to match the actual data length to the specified size to prevent serialization and deserialization errors:

 - **`uint` and `int`** - the specified size must be large enough to accommodate the data value. For instance, storing a value greater than 255 in a single byte (`uint8`) will fail since it exceeds the byte’s capacity. Similarly, an undersized integer (e.g., specifying 2 bytes for a 4-byte integer) can lead to data loss or deserialization failure
 - **`bytes`** - the data must match the specified byte length in the layout. For example, defining a field as 32 bytes (`size: 32`) requires the provided data to be exactly 32 bytes long; otherwise, serialization will fail

```typescript
// Pitfall: Mismatch between the size of data and the defined size in the layout
{ name: 'orderSender', binary: 'bytes', size: 32 }
// If the provided data is not exactly 32 bytes, this will fail
```

#### Incorrectly Defined Arrays

Arrays can be fixed-length or length-prefixed, so it’s important to define them correctly. Fixed-length arrays must match the specified length, while length-prefixed arrays need a `lengthSize` field.

```typescript
// Pitfall: Array length does not match the expected size
{ name: 'redeemerMessage', binary: 'bytes', lengthSize: 4 }
```

### Best Practices

These best practices and common pitfalls can help prevent bugs and improve the reliability of your implementation when working with layouts in the Wormhole SDK.

#### Reuse Predefined Layout Items

Rather than defining sizes or types manually, reuse the predefined layout items provided by the Wormhole SDK. These items ensure consistent formatting and enforce strong typing.

For instance, use the `chainItem` layout for chain IDs or `universalAddressItem` for blockchain addresses:

```typescript
import {
  chainItem,
  universalAddressItem,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core/layout-items';

const exampleLayout = [
  { name: 'sourceChain', ...chainItem() }, // Use predefined chain ID layout
  { name: 'senderAddress', ...universalAddressItem }, // Use universal address layout
] as const;
```

By leveraging predefined layout items, you reduce redundancy, maintain consistency, and ensure compatibility with Wormhole’s standards.

#### Use Class Instances

Whenever possible, convert deserialized data into higher-level class instances. This makes it easier to validate, manipulate, and interact with structured data. For example, the [`UniversalAddress`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/definitions/src/universalAddress.ts#L17-L59){target=\_blank} class ensures consistent address handling:

```typescript
import { UniversalAddress } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core';

const deserializedAddress = new UniversalAddress(someBinaryData);
```

Focusing on reusing predefined layout items and converting deserialized data into higher-level abstractions can ensure a more robust and maintainable implementation.

#### Consistent Error Handling

Always handle errors during both serialization and deserialization. Catching exceptions allows you to log or resolve issues gracefully when working with potentially corrupted or invalid data.

```typescript
try {
  const deserialized = deserializeLayout(fillLayout, data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Deserialization failed:', error);
}
```

#### Leverage Reusable Layouts

Creating reusable layouts for commonly repeated structures improves code maintainability and reduces duplication. These layouts can represent fields or combinations of fields frequently encountered in cross-chain communication, such as chain IDs, addresses, and signatures.

For example, define a reusable layout for chain IDs and addresses:

```typescript
const commonLayout = [
  { name: 'chainId', binary: 'uint', size: 2 },
  { name: 'address', binary: 'bytes', size: 32 },
] as const satisfies Layout;

// Reuse the common layout in different contexts
const exampleLayout = [
  ...commonLayout,
  { name: 'sequence', binary: 'uint', size: 8 },
];
```

By abstracting common elements into a single layout, you ensure consistency across different parts of your application and simplify future updates.

## Performance Considerations

Efficient serialization and deserialization are crucial when handling large amounts of cross-chain data. Below are some strategies and best practices to ensure optimal performance when using Wormhole SDK layouts.

### Lazy Instantiation

Building a discriminator can be resource-intensive for complex or large datasets. The layout structures do not incur significant upfront costs, but deferring the creation of discriminators until needed can improve efficiency.

```typescript
const lazyDiscriminator = lazyInstantiate(() => layoutDiscriminator(layouts));
```

This approach ensures that discriminators are only built when required, helping to optimize performance, especially for complex or conditional layouts.

## Resources

For further learning and practical experience, explore the following resources:

 - **Wormhole TypeScript SDK** - the [Wormhole SDK repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank} contains the core implementation of layouts, including predefined layout items and utilities like `serializeLayout` and `deserializeLayout`

# VAAs and Protocols

## Introduction

Wormhole's core functionality revolves around [Verifiable Action Approvals](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} (VAAs), which are signed messages enabling secure and decentralized communication across chains. This guide focuses on their practical usage within the Wormhole ecosystem, specifically when working with protocol-specific messages in the [TypeScript](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank} and [Solidity](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank} SDKs.

For deeper insights into serialization, deserialization, and protocol design, refer to:

- [Data Layouts](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/sdk-layout/){target=\_blank} for serialization concepts
- [Building Protocols and Payloads](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/protocols-payloads/){target=\_blank} for designing custom protocol messages

This guide will help you understand how to handle VAAs and protocol messages in off-chain and on-chain scenarios.

## VAA Structure

Understanding the structure of VAAs is fundamental to working with Wormhole's SDKs. Each section of the VAA—Header, Envelope, and Payload—serves a specific role:

| Section  | Description                                                                                              |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Header   |  Includes the version and guardian signature information required to verify the VAA                      |
| Envelope |  Contains metadata about the emitted message, such as the emitter chain, emitter address, and timestamp  |
| Payload  |  Represents the actual message, in raw bytes, without a length prefix                                    |

The VAA's body combines the Envelope and Payload. The Wormhole Guardians signed the core data and hashed (using `keccak256`) to generate the VAA's unique identifier.

When integrating protocols like Token Bridge or Wormhole Relayer:

- The TypeScript SDK handles VAAs off-chain, focusing on deserialization, validation, and payload extraction before submission
- The Solidity SDK processes VAAs on-chain, using libraries like `VaaLib` to decode and execute protocol actions

## VAAs in Protocol Contexts

### How VAAs Enable Protocol-Specific Messaging

VAAs are the backbone of Wormhole's cross-chain communication, encapsulating critical protocol payloads that drive actions on different blockchains. Each protocol—such as [Token Bridge](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/tree/main/core/definitions/src/protocols/tokenBridge){target=\_blank}, [Wormhole Relayer](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/tree/main/core/definitions/src/protocols/relayer){target=\_blank}, or [Circle CCTP](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/tree/main/core/definitions/src/protocols/circleBridge){target=\_blank}—uses VAAs to securely transmit its messages across chains.

Examples of mapping protocols to VAAs:

| Protocol        | Payload Purpose                                           | Example                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Token Bridge    |  Transfers token data and metadata                        |  Token transfer or redemption      |
| Wormhole Relayer|  Manages delivery instructions for messages across chains |  Delivery fee or refund handling   |
| Circle CCTP     |  Facilitates stablecoin mint-and-burn operations          |  Circle-issued stablecoin transfer |

Each protocol integrates its payload format into the VAA structure, ensuring consistent message validation and execution across the ecosystem.

### TypeScript SDK: Off-Chain Handling of VAAs

The TypeScript SDK is designed for off-chain operations like reading, validating, and manipulating VAAs before submitting them to a chain. Developers can easily deserialize VAAs to extract protocol payloads and prepare actions such as initiating token transfers or constructing delivery instructions.

In the example below, we use the real [`envelopeLayout`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/dd6bd2463264680597519285ff559f9e92e85ca7/core/definitions/src/vaa/vaa.ts#L44-L51){target=\_blank} from Wormhole's TS SDK to deserialize and extract essential information like the emitter chain, sequence, and [consistency (finality) level](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank}:

```typescript
import { deserializeLayout } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-base';
import {
  universalAddressItem,
  sequenceItem,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/core/layout-items/index.js';

export const envelopeLayout = [
  { name: 'timestamp', binary: 'uint', size: 4 },
  { name: 'nonce', binary: 'uint', size: 4 },
  { name: 'emitterChain', binary: 'uint', size: 2 },
  { name: 'emitterAddress', ...universalAddressItem },
  { name: 'sequence', ...sequenceItem },
  { name: 'consistencyLevel', binary: 'uint', size: 1 },
] as const satisfies Layout;

const encodedEnvelope = new Uint8Array([
  /* binary envelope data */
]);
const deserializedEnvelope = deserializeLayout(envelopeLayout, encodedEnvelope);
```

For more details, you can refer to the [parseVAA example](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/examples/src/parseVaa.ts){target=\_blank} in the Wormhole SDK repository.

### Solidity SDK: On-Chain Handling of VAAs

The Solidity SDK enables on-chain processing of VAAs directly within smart contracts. This is essential for real-time validation, decoding, and execution of protocol-specific payloads. Developers can use libraries like [`VaaLib`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/e19013d08d1fdf5af9e6344c637e36a270422dd9/src/libraries/VaaLib.sol){target=\_blank} to parse the VAA header and payload, ensuring the message is authentic and consistent with Wormhole's validation.

Below is an example of parsing an envelope on-chain using the Solidity SDK:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache 2
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import {VaaLib} from "wormhole-sdk/libraries/VaaLib.sol";

contract EnvelopeParser {
    using VaaLib for bytes;

    function parseEnvelope(
        bytes memory encodedVaa
    )
        public
        pure
        returns (
            uint32 timestamp,
            uint32 nonce,
            uint16 emitterChainId,
            bytes32 emitterAddress,
            uint64 sequence,
            uint8 consistencyLevel
        )
    {
        // Skip the header and decode the envelope
        uint offset = VaaLib.skipVaaHeaderMemUnchecked(encodedVaa, 0);
        return VaaLib.decodeVaaEnvelopeMemUnchecked(encodedVaa, offset);
    }
}
```

To install the meta package using npm, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk
```

This package combines all the individual packages to make setup easier while allowing for tree shaking.  

### Advanced

Alternatively, you can install a specific set of published packages individually:

??? interface "`sdk-base` - exposes constants"

    ```sh
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-base
    ```

??? interface "`sdk-definitions` - exposes contract interfaces, basic types, and VAA payload definitions"

    ```sh
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-definitions
    ```

??? interface "`sdk-evm` - exposes EVM-specific utilities"

    ```sh
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm
    ```

??? interface "`sdk-evm-tokenbridge` - exposes the EVM Token Bridge protocol client"

    ```sh
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm-tokenbridge
    ```

## Usage

Getting your integration started is simple. First, import Wormhole:

```ts
import { wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';

import { Wormhole, amount, signSendWait } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import algorand from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/algorand';
import aptos from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/aptos';
import cosmwasm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/cosmwasm';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import { getSigner } from './helpers/index.js';

(async function () {
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [
    evm,
    solana,
    aptos,
    algorand,
    cosmwasm,
    sui,
  ]);

  const ctx = wh.getChain('Solana');

  const rcv = wh.getChain('Algorand');

  const sender = await getSigner(ctx);
  const receiver = await getSigner(rcv);

  // Get a Token Bridge contract client on the source
  const sndTb = await ctx.getTokenBridge();

  // Send the native token of the source chain
  const tokenId = Wormhole.tokenId(ctx.chain, 'native');

  // Bigint amount using `amount` module
  const amt = amount.units(amount.parse('0.1', ctx.config.nativeTokenDecimals));

  // Create a transaction stream for transfers
  const transfer = sndTb.transfer(
    sender.address.address,
    receiver.address,
    tokenId.address,
    amt
  );

  // Sign and send the transaction
  const txids = await signSendWait(ctx, transfer, sender.signer);
  console.log('Sent: ', txids);

  // Get the Wormhole message ID from the transaction
  const [whm] = await ctx.parseTransaction(txids[txids.length - 1]!.txid);
  console.log('Wormhole Messages: ', whm);

  const vaa = await wh.getVaa(
    // Wormhole Message ID
    whm!,
    // Protocol:Payload name to use for decoding the VAA payload
    'TokenBridge:Transfer',
    // Timeout in milliseconds, depending on the chain and network, the VAA may take some time to be available
    60_000
  );

  // Now get the token bridge on the redeem side
  const rcvTb = await rcv.getTokenBridge();

  // Create a transaction stream for redeeming
  const redeem = rcvTb.redeem(receiver.address.address, vaa!);

  // Sign and send the transaction
  const rcvTxids = await signSendWait(rcv, redeem, receiver.signer);
  console.log('Sent: ', rcvTxids);

  // Now check if the transfer is completed according to
  // the destination token bridge
  const finished = await rcvTb.isTransferCompleted(vaa!);
  console.log('Transfer completed: ', finished);
})();
```

Then, import each of the ecosystem [platforms](#platforms) that you wish to support:

```ts
import aptos from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/aptos';
import cosmwasm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/cosmwasm';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
```


To make the [platform](#platforms) modules available for use, pass them to the Wormhole constructor:

```ts
evm,
    solana,
    aptos,
    algorand,
    cosmwasm,
    sui,
  ]);
```

With a configured Wormhole object, you can do things like parse addresses for the provided platforms, get a [`ChainContext`](#chain-context) object, or fetch VAAs.

```ts

```

You can retrieve a VAA as follows. In this example, a timeout of `60,000` milliseconds is used. The amount of time required for the VAA to become available will vary by network.

```ts
// Wormhole Message ID
    whm!,
    // Protocol:Payload name to use for decoding the VAA payload
    'TokenBridge:Transfer',
    // Timeout in milliseconds, depending on the chain and network, the VAA may take some time to be available
    60_000
  );
```

import cosmwasm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/cosmwasm';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import { getSigner } from './helpers/index.js';

(async function () {
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [
    evm,
    solana,
    aptos,
    algorand,
    cosmwasm,
    sui,
  ]);

  const ctx = wh.getChain('Solana');

  const rcv = wh.getChain('Algorand');

  const sender = await getSigner(ctx);
  const receiver = await getSigner(rcv);

  // Get a Token Bridge contract client on the source
  const sndTb = await ctx.getTokenBridge();

  // Send the native token of the source chain
  const tokenId = Wormhole.tokenId(ctx.chain, 'native');

  // Bigint amount using `amount` module
  const amt = amount.units(amount.parse('0.1', ctx.config.nativeTokenDecimals));

  // Create a transaction stream for transfers
  const transfer = sndTb.transfer(
    sender.address.address,
    receiver.address,
    tokenId.address,
    amt
  );

  // Sign and send the transaction
  const txids = await signSendWait(ctx, transfer, sender.signer);
  console.log('Sent: ', txids);

  // Get the Wormhole message ID from the transaction
  const [whm] = await ctx.parseTransaction(txids[txids.length - 1]!.txid);
  console.log('Wormhole Messages: ', whm);

  const vaa = await wh.getVaa(
    // Wormhole Message ID
    whm!,
    // Protocol:Payload name to use for decoding the VAA payload
    'TokenBridge:Transfer',
    // Timeout in milliseconds, depending on the chain and network, the VAA may take some time to be available
    60_000
  );

  // Now get the token bridge on the redeem side
  const rcvTb = await rcv.getTokenBridge();

  // Create a transaction stream for redeeming
  const redeem = rcvTb.redeem(receiver.address.address, vaa!);

  // Sign and send the transaction
  const rcvTxids = await signSendWait(rcv, redeem, receiver.signer);
  console.log('Sent: ', rcvTxids);

  // Now check if the transfer is completed according to
  // the destination token bridge
  const finished = await rcvTb.isTransferCompleted(vaa!);
  console.log('Transfer completed: ', finished);
})();
    ```

Optionally, you can override the default configuration with a partial `WormholeConfig` object to specify particular fields, such as a different RPC endpoint.

```ts
const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [solana], {
  chains: {
    Solana: {
      contracts: {
        coreBridge: '11111111111111111111111111111',
      },
      rpc: 'https://api.devnet.solana.com',
    },
  },
});
```

??? code "View the complete script"
    ```ts
    import { wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
(async function () {
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [solana], {
    chains: {
      Solana: {
        contracts: {
          coreBridge: '11111111111111111111111111111',
        },
        rpc: 'https://api.devnet.solana.com',
      },
    },
  });
  console.log(wh.config.chains.Solana);
})();
    ```

## Concepts

Understanding several higher-level Wormhole concepts and how the SDK abstracts them away will help you use the tools most effectively. The following sections will introduce and discuss the concepts of platforms, chain contexts, addresses, signers, and protocols, how they are used in the Wormhole context, and how the SDK helps ease development in each conceptual area.

### Platforms

While every chain has unique attributes, chains from the same platform typically have standard functionalities they share. The SDK includes `Platform` modules, which create a standardized interface for interacting with the chains of a supported platform. The contents of a module vary by platform but can include:

- Protocols, such as [Wormhole core](#wormhole-core), preconfigured to suit the selected platform
- Definitions and configurations for types, signers, addresses, and chains 
- Helpers configured for dealing with unsigned transactions on the selected platform

These modules also import and expose essential functions and define types or constants from the chain's native ecosystem to reduce the dependencies needed to interact with a chain using Wormhole. Rather than installing the entire native package for each desired platform, you can install a targeted package of standardized functions and definitions essential to connecting with Wormhole, keeping project dependencies as slim as possible.


Wormhole currently supports the following platforms:

- EVM
- Solana
- Cosmos
- Sui
- Aptos
- Algorand

See the [Platforms folder of the TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/tree/main/platforms){target=\_blank} for an up-to-date list of the platforms supported by the Wormhole TypeScript SDK.

### Chain Context

The `definitions` package of the SDK includes the `ChainContext` class, which creates an interface for working with connected chains in a standardized way. This class contains the network, chain, and platform configurations for connected chains and cached RPC and protocol clients. The `ChainContext` class also exposes chain-specific methods and utilities. Much of the functionality comes from the `Platform` methods but some specific chains may have overridden methods via the context. This is also where the `Network`, `Chain`, and `Platform` type parameters which are used throughout the package are defined.

```ts
const srcChain = wh.getChain(senderAddress.chain);
const dstChain = wh.getChain(receiverAddress.chain);

const tb = await srcChain.getTokenBridge(); // => TokenBridge<'Evm'>
srcChain.getRpcClient(); // => RpcClient<'Evm'>
```

### Addresses

The SDK uses the `UniversalAddress` class to implement the `Address` interface, which all address types must implement. Addresses from various networks are parsed into their byte representation and modified as needed to ensure they are exactly 32 bytes long. Each platform also has an address type that understands the native address formats, referred to as `NativeAddress.` These abstractions allow you to work with addresses consistently regardless of the underlying chain.

```ts
// It's possible to convert a string address to its Native address
const ethAddr: NativeAddress<'Evm'> = toNative('Ethereum', '0xbeef...');

// A common type in the SDK is the `ChainAddress` which provides
// the additional context of the `Chain` this address is relevant for
const senderAddress: ChainAddress = Wormhole.chainAddress(
  'Ethereum',
  '0xbeef...'
);
const receiverAddress: ChainAddress = Wormhole.chainAddress(
  'Solana',
  'Sol1111...'
);

// Convert the ChainAddress back to its canonical string address format
const strAddress = Wormhole.canonicalAddress(senderAddress); // => '0xbeef...'

// Or if the ethAddr above is for an emitter and you need the UniversalAddress
const emitterAddr = ethAddr.toUniversalAddress().toString();
```

### Tokens

Similar to the `ChainAddress` type, the `TokenId` type provides the chain and address of a given token. The following snippet introduces `TokenId`, a way to uniquely identify any token, whether it's a standard token or a blockchain's native currency (like ETH for Ethereum).

Wormhole uses their contract address to create a `TokenId` for standard tokens. For native currencies, Wormhole uses the keyword `native` instead of an address. This makes it easy to work with any type of token consistently.

Finally, the snippet demonstrates how to convert a `TokenId` back into a regular address format when needed.

```ts
const sourceToken: TokenId = Wormhole.tokenId('Ethereum', '0xbeef...');

const gasToken: TokenId = Wormhole.tokenId('Ethereum', 'native');

const strAddress = Wormhole.canonicalAddress(senderAddress); // => '0xbeef...'
```

### Signers

Certain methods of signing transactions require a `Signer` interface in the SDK. Depending on the specific requirements, this interface can be fulfilled by either a `SignOnlySigner` or a `SignAndSendSigner`. A signer can be created by wrapping an offline or web wallet.

A `SignOnlySigner` is used when the signer isn't connected to the network or prefers not to broadcast transactions themselves. It accepts an array of unsigned transactions and returns an array of signed and serialized transactions. Before signing, the transactions may be inspected or altered. It's important to note that the serialization process is chain-specific. Refer to the testing signers (e.g., [EVM](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/connect-sdk/blob/main/platforms/evm/src/signer.ts){target=\_blank} or [Solana](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/connect-sdk/blob/main/platforms/solana/src/signer.ts){target=\_blank}) for an example of how to implement a signer for a specific chain or platform.

Conversely, a `SignAndSendSigner` is appropriate when the signer is connected to the network and intends to broadcast the transactions. This type of signer also accepts an array of unsigned transactions but returns an array of transaction IDs corresponding to the order of the unsigned transactions.

```ts
export type Signer = SignOnlySigner | SignAndSendSigner;

export interface SignOnlySigner {
  chain(): ChainName;
  address(): string;
  // Accept an array of unsigned transactions and return
  // an array of signed and serialized transactions.
  // The transactions may be inspected or altered before
  // signing.
  sign(tx: UnsignedTransaction[]): Promise<SignedTx[]>;
}

export interface SignAndSendSigner {
  chain(): ChainName;
  address(): string;
  // Accept an array of unsigned transactions and return
  // an array of transaction ids in the same order as the
  // unsignedTransactions array.
  signAndSend(tx: UnsignedTransaction[]): Promise<TxHash[]>;
}
```

#### Set Up a Signer with Ethers.js

To sign transactions programmatically with the Wormhole SDK, you can use Ethers.js to manage private keys and handle signing. Here's an example of setting up a signer using Ethers.js:

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Update the following variables
const rpcUrl = 'INSERT_RPC_URL';
const privateKey = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';
const toAddress = 'INSERT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS';

// Set up a provider and signer
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

// Example: Signing and sending a transaction
async function sendTransaction() {
  const tx = {
    to: toAddress,
    value: ethers.parseUnits('0.1'), // Sending 0.1 ETH
    gasPrice: await provider.getGasPrice(),
    gasLimit: ethers.toBeHex(21000),
  };

  const transaction = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
  console.log('Transaction hash:', transaction.hash);
}
sendTransaction();
```

 - **`provider`** - responsible for connecting to the Ethereum network (or any EVM-compatible network). It acts as a bridge between your application and the blockchain, allowing you to fetch data, check the state of the blockchain, and submit transactions

 - **`signer`** - represents the account that will sign the transaction. In this case, you’re creating a signer using the private key associated with the account. The signer is responsible for authorizing transactions by digitally signing them with the private key

 - **`Wallet`** - combines both the provider (for blockchain interaction) and the signer (for transaction authorization), allowing you to sign and send transactions programmatically

These components work together to create, sign, and submit a transaction to the blockchain.

???- tip "Managing Private Keys Securely"
    Handling private keys is unavoidable, so it’s crucial to manage them securely. Here are some best practices:

     - **Use environment variables** - avoid hardcoding private keys in your code. Use environment variables or secret management tools to inject private keys securely
     - **Hardware wallets** - for production environments, consider integrating hardware wallets to keep private keys secure while allowing programmatic access through the SDK

### Protocols

While Wormhole is a Generic Message Passing (GMP) protocol, several protocols have been built to provide specific functionality. If available, each protocol will have a platform-specific implementation. These implementations provide methods to generate transactions or read state from the contract on-chain.

#### Wormhole Core

The core protocol underlies all Wormhole activity. This protocol is responsible for emitting the message containing the information necessary to perform bridging, including the [emitter address](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/reference/glossary#emitter){target=\_blank}, the [sequence number](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/reference/glossary#sequence){target=\_blank} for the message, and the payload of the message itself.

The following example demonstrates sending and verifying a message using the Wormhole Core protocol on Solana.

First, initialize a Wormhole instance for the Testnet environment, specifically for the Solana chain. Then, obtain a signer and its associated address, which will be used to sign transactions.

Next, get a reference to the core messaging bridge, which is the main interface for interacting with Wormhole's cross-chain messaging capabilities.
The code then prepares a message for publication. This message includes:

- The sender's address
- The message payload (in this case, the encoded string `lol`)
- A nonce (set to `0` here, but can be any user-defined value to uniquely identify the message)
- A [consistency (finality) level](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} (set to `0`, which determines the finality requirements for the message)

After preparing the message, the next steps are to generate, sign, and send the transaction or transactions required to publish the message on the Solana blockchain. Once the transaction is confirmed, the Wormhole message ID is extracted from the transaction logs. This ID is crucial for tracking the message across chains.

The code then waits for the Wormhole network to process and sign the message, turning it into a Verified Action Approval (VAA). This VAA is retrieved in a `Uint8Array` format, with a timeout of 60 seconds.

Lastly, the code will demonstrate how to verify the message on the receiving end. A verification transaction is prepared using the original sender's address and the VAA, and finally, this transaction is signed and sent.

???+ code "View the complete script"
    ```ts
    import { encoding, signSendWait, wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import { getSigner } from './helpers/index.js';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';

(async function () {
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [solana, evm]);

  const chain = wh.getChain('Avalanche');
  const { signer, address } = await getSigner(chain);

  // Get a reference to the core messaging bridge
  const coreBridge = await chain.getWormholeCore();

  // Generate transactions, sign and send them
  const publishTxs = coreBridge.publishMessage(
    // Address of sender (emitter in VAA)
    address.address,
    // Message to send (payload in VAA)
    encoding.bytes.encode('lol'),
    // Nonce (user defined, no requirement for a specific value, useful to provide a unique identifier for the message)
    0,
    // ConsistencyLevel (ie finality of the message, see wormhole docs for more)
    0
  );
  // Send the transaction(s) to publish the message
  const txids = await signSendWait(chain, publishTxs, signer);

  // Take the last txid in case multiple were sent
  // The last one should be the one containing the relevant
  // event or log info
  const txid = txids[txids.length - 1];

  // Grab the wormhole message id from the transaction logs or storage
  const [whm] = await chain.parseTransaction(txid!.txid);

  // Wait for the vaa to be signed and available with a timeout
  const vaa = await wh.getVaa(whm!, 'Uint8Array', 60_000);
  console.log(vaa);

  // Note: calling verifyMessage manually is typically not a useful thing to do
  // As the VAA is typically submitted to the counterpart contract for
  // A given protocol and the counterpart contract will verify the VAA
  // This is simply for demo purposes
  const verifyTxs = coreBridge.verifyMessage(address.address, vaa!);
  console.log(await signSendWait(chain, verifyTxs, signer));
})();
    ```

The payload contains the information necessary to perform whatever action is required based on the protocol that uses it.

#### Token Bridge

The most familiar protocol built on Wormhole is the Token Bridge. Every chain has a `TokenBridge` protocol client that provides a consistent interface for interacting with the Token Bridge, which includes methods to generate the transactions required to transfer tokens and methods to generate and redeem attestations. `WormholeTransfer` abstractions are the recommended way to interact with these protocols, but it is possible to use them directly.

```ts
import { signSendWait } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';

const tb = await srcChain.getTokenBridge(); 

const token = '0xdeadbeef...';
const txGenerator = tb.createAttestation(token); 
const txids = await signSendWait(srcChain, txGenerator, src.signer);
```

Supported protocols are defined in the [definitions module](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/connect-sdk/tree/main/core/definitions/src/protocols){target=\_blank}.

## Transfers

While using the [`ChainContext`](#chain-context) and [`Protocol`](#protocols) clients directly is possible, the SDK provides some helpful abstractions for transferring tokens.

The `WormholeTransfer` interface provides a convenient abstraction to encapsulate the steps involved in a cross-chain transfer.

### Token Transfers

Performing a token transfer is trivial for any source and destination chains. You can create a new `Wormhole` object to make objects like `TokenTransfer` and `CircleTransfer`, to transfer tokens between chains.

The following example demonstrates the process of initiating and completing a token transfer. It starts by creating a `TokenTransfer` object, which tracks the transfer's state throughout its lifecycle. The code then obtains a quote for the transfer, ensuring the amount is sufficient to cover fees and any requested native gas.

The transfer process is divided into three main steps:

1. Initiating the transfer on the source chain
2. Waiting for the transfer to be attested (if not automatic)
3. Completing the transfer on the destination chain

For automatic transfers, the process ends after initiation. The code waits for the transfer to be attested for manual transfers and then completes it on the destination chain.

```ts
const xfer = await wh.tokenTransfer(
    route.token,
    route.amount,
    route.source.address,
    route.destination.address,
    route.delivery?.automatic ?? false,
    route.payload,
    route.delivery?.nativeGas
  );

  const quote = await TokenTransfer.quoteTransfer(
    wh,
    route.source.chain,
    route.destination.chain,
    xfer.transfer
  );
  console.log(quote);

  if (xfer.transfer.automatic && quote.destinationToken.amount < 0)
    throw 'The amount requested is too low to cover the fee and any native gas requested.';

  // 1) Submit the transactions to the source chain, passing a signer to sign any txns
  console.log('Starting transfer');
  const srcTxids = await xfer.initiateTransfer(route.source.signer);
  console.log(`Started transfer: `, srcTxids);

  // If automatic, we're done
  if (route.delivery?.automatic) return xfer;

  // 2) Wait for the VAA to be signed and ready (not required for auto transfer)
  console.log('Getting Attestation');
  const attestIds = await xfer.fetchAttestation(60_000);
  console.log(`Got Attestation: `, attestIds);

  // 3) Redeem the VAA on the dest chain
  console.log('Completing Transfer');
  const destTxids = await xfer.completeTransfer(route.destination.signer);
  console.log(`Completed Transfer: `, destTxids);
```

    ```

Internally, this uses the [TokenBridge](#token-bridge) protocol client to transfer tokens. Like other Protocols, the `TokenBridge` protocol provides a consistent set of methods across all chains to generate a set of transactions for that specific chain.

### Native USDC Transfers

You can also transfer native USDC using [Circle's CCTP](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol){target=\_blank}. Please note that if the transfer is set to `Automatic` mode, a fee for performing the relay will be included in the quote. This fee is deducted from the total amount requested to be sent. For example, if the user wishes to receive `1.0` on the destination, the amount sent should be adjusted to `1.0` plus the relay fee. The same principle applies to native gas drop offs.

In the following example, the `wh.circleTransfer` function is called with several parameters to set up the transfer. It takes the amount to be transferred (in the token's base units), the sender's chain and address, and the receiver's chain and address. The function also allows specifying whether the transfer should be automatic, meaning it will be completed without further user intervention.

An optional payload can be included with the transfer, though it's set to undefined in this case. Finally, if the transfer is automatic, you can request that native gas (the blockchain's native currency used for transaction fees) be sent to the receiver along with the transferred tokens.

When waiting for the `VAA`, a timeout of `60,000` milliseconds is used. The amount of time required for the VAA to become available will [vary by network](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/required-block-confirmations#mainnet){target=\_blank}.

```ts
// Amount as bigint (base units)
    req.amount,
    // Sender chain/address
    src.address,
    // Receiver chain/address
    dst.address,
    // Automatic delivery boolean
    req.automatic,
    // Payload to be sent with the transfer
    undefined,
    // If automatic, native gas can be requested to be sent to the receiver
    req.nativeGas
  );

  // Note, if the transfer is requested to be Automatic, a fee for performing the relay
  // will be present in the quote. The fee comes out of the amount requested to be sent.
  // If the user wants to receive 1.0 on the destination, the amount to send should be 1.0 + fee.
  // The same applies for native gas dropoff
  const quote = await CircleTransfer.quoteTransfer(
    src.chain,
    dst.chain,
    xfer.transfer
  );
  console.log('Quote', quote);

  console.log('Starting Transfer');
  const srcTxids = await xfer.initiateTransfer(src.signer);
  console.log(`Started Transfer: `, srcTxids);

  if (req.automatic) {
    const relayStatus = await waitForRelay(srcTxids[srcTxids.length - 1]!);
    console.log(`Finished relay: `, relayStatus);
    return;
  }

### Recovering Transfers

It may be necessary to recover an abandoned transfer before it is completed. To do this, instantiate the `Transfer` class with the `from` static method and pass one of several types of identifiers. A `TransactionId` or `WormholeMessageId` may be used to recover the transfer.

```ts
const attestIds = await xfer.fetchAttestation(60 * 60 * 1000);
  console.log('Got attestation: ', attestIds);

  const dstTxIds = await xfer.completeTransfer(signer);
  console.log('Completed transfer: ', dstTxIds);

    ```

## Routes

While a specific `WormholeTransfer`, such as `TokenTransfer` or `CCTPTransfer`, may be used, the developer must know exactly which transfer type to use for a given request.

To provide a more flexible and generic interface, the `Wormhole` class provides a method to produce a `RouteResolver` that can be configured with a set of possible routes to be supported.

The following section demonstrates setting up and validating a token transfer using Wormhole's routing system.

```ts
const resolver = wh.resolver([
    routes.TokenBridgeRoute, // manual token bridge
    routes.AutomaticTokenBridgeRoute, // automatic token bridge
    routes.CCTPRoute, // manual CCTP
    routes.AutomaticCCTPRoute, // automatic CCTP
    routes.AutomaticPorticoRoute, // Native eth transfers
  ]);
```

Once created, the resolver can be used to provide a list of input and possible output tokens.

```ts
const srcTokens = await resolver.supportedSourceTokens(sendChain);
  console.log(
    'Allowed source tokens: ',
    srcTokens.map((t) => canonicalAddress(t))
  );

  const sendToken = Wormhole.tokenId(sendChain.chain, 'native');

  // Given the send token, what can we possibly get on the destination chain?
  const destTokens = await resolver.supportedDestinationTokens(
    sendToken,
    sendChain,
    destChain
  );
  console.log(
    'For the given source token and routes configured, the following tokens may be receivable: ',
    destTokens.map((t) => canonicalAddress(t))
  );
  // Grab the first one for the example
  const destinationToken = destTokens[0]!;
```

Once the tokens are selected, a `RouteTransferRequest` may be created to provide a list of routes that can fulfill the request. Creating a transfer request fetches the token details since all routes will need to know about the tokens.

```ts
// Since all routes will need to know about the tokens
  const tr = await routes.RouteTransferRequest.create(wh, {
    source: sendToken,
    destination: destinationToken,
  });

  // Resolve the transfer request to a set of routes that can perform it
  const foundRoutes = await resolver.findRoutes(tr);
  console.log(
    'For the transfer parameters, we found these routes: ',
    foundRoutes
  );
```

Choosing the best route is currently left to the developer, but strategies might include sorting by output amount or expected time to complete the transfer (no estimate is currently provided).

After choosing the best route, extra parameters like `amount`, `nativeGasDropoff`, and `slippage` can be passed, depending on the specific route selected. A quote can be retrieved with the validated request.

After successful validation, the code requests a transfer quote. This quote likely includes important details such as fees, estimated time, and the final amount to be received. If the quote is generated successfully, it's displayed for the user to review and decide whether to proceed with the transfer. This process ensures that all transfer details are properly set up and verified before any actual transfer occurs.

```ts
'This route offers the following default options',
    bestRoute.getDefaultOptions()
  );

  // Specify the amount as a decimal string
  const amt = '0.001';
  // Create the transfer params for this request
  const transferParams = { amount: amt, options: { nativeGas: 0 } };

  // Validate the transfer params passed, this returns a new type of ValidatedTransferParams
  // which (believe it or not) is a validated version of the input params
  // This new var must be passed to the next step, quote
  const validated = await bestRoute.validate(tr, transferParams);
  if (!validated.valid) throw validated.error;
  console.log('Validated parameters: ', validated.params);

  // Get a quote for the transfer, this too returns a new type that must
  // be passed to the next step, execute (if you like the quote)
  const quote = await bestRoute.quote(tr, validated.params);
  if (!quote.success) throw quote.error;
  console.log('Best route quote: ', quote);
```

Finally, assuming the quote looks good, the route can initiate the request with the quote and the `signer`.

```ts
tr,
      sender.signer,
      quote,
      receiver.address
    );
    console.log('Initiated transfer with receipt: ', receipt);
```

  // If you're sure you want to do this, set this to true
  const imSure = false;
  if (imSure) {
    // Now the transfer may be initiated
    // A receipt will be returned, guess what you gotta do with that?
    const receipt = await bestRoute.initiate(
      tr,
      sender.signer,
      quote,
      receiver.address
    );
    console.log('Initiated transfer with receipt: ', receipt);

    // Kick off a wait log, if there is an opportunity to complete, this function will do it
    // See the implementation for how this works
    await routes.checkAndCompleteTransfer(bestRoute, receipt, receiver.signer);
  } else {
    console.log('Not initiating transfer (set `imSure` to true to do so)');
  }
})();

### Routes as Plugins

Routes can be imported from any npm package that exports them and configured with the resolver. Custom routes must extend [`Route`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/0c57292368146c460abc9ce9e7f6a42be8e0b903/connect/src/routes/route.ts#L21-L64){target=\_blank} and implement [`StaticRouteMethods`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/0c57292368146c460abc9ce9e7f6a42be8e0b903/connect/src/routes/route.ts#L101){target=\_blank}.

```ts
import { Network, routes } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-connect';

export class CustomRoute<N extends Network>
  extends routes.Route<N>
  implements routes.StaticRouteMethods<typeof CustomRoute>
{
  static meta = {
    name: 'CustomRoute',
  };
  // implementation...
}
```

A noteworthy example of a route exported from a separate npm package is Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT). See the [`NttAutomaticRoute`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/66f8e414223a77f5c736541db0a7a85396cab71c/sdk/route/src/automatic.ts#L48){target=\_blank} route implementation.

description: Learn how to interact directly with Circle's CCTP Bridge contracts, including TokenMessenger, TokenMinter, and MessageTransmitter.

# Get Started with CCTP

## Introduction

Circle's [Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)](/docs/learn/transfers/cctp/){target=\_blank} by Circle is a permissionless utility that facilitates secure and efficient USDC transfers across blockchain networks through native burning and minting mechanisms.

As decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols evolve, the need for flexible, secure cross-chain messaging has expanded, requiring solutions beyond simple asset transfers. Wormhole enhances CCTP's capabilities by allowing developers to compose more complex cross-chain interactions. With Wormhole's generic messaging, applications can execute smart contract logic alongside native USDC transfers, enabling richer, more versatile cross-chain experiences.

This guide will walk you through getting started with Wormhole's CCTP contracts and show you how to integrate CCTP into your smart contracts, enabling the composition of advanced cross-chain functions with native USDC transfers.

## Prerequisites

To interact with the Wormhole CCTP, you'll need the following:

- [The address of the CCTP contract](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#cctp){target=\_blank} on the chains you're deploying your contract on
- [The Wormhole chain ID](/docs/build/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} of the chains you're deploying your contract on

## Wormhole's CCTP Integration Contract

Wormhole's Circle Integration contract, `CircleIntegration.sol`, is the contract you'll interact with directly. It burns and mints Circle-supported tokens by using [Circle's CCTP contracts](#circles-cctp-contracts).

The Circle Integration contract emits Wormhole messages with arbitrary payloads to allow additional composability when performing cross-chain transfers of Circle-supported assets.

This contract can be found in [Wormhole's `wormhole-circle-integration` repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-circle-integration/){target=\_blank} on GitHub.

!!! note
    Wormhole supports all CCTP-supported chains, but Circle currently supports only a [handful of chains](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/supported-domains){target=\_blank}. Please refer to the [CCTP section of the Contract Addresses](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#cctp){target=\_blank} reference page to view the complete list of supported chains.

## Circle's CCTP Contracts

Three key contracts power Circle's CCTP:

- **`TokenMessenger`** - the entry point for cross-chain USDC transfers, routing messages to initiate USDC burns on the source chain, and mint USDC on the destination chain
- **`MessageTransmitter`** - handles generic message passing, sending messages from the source chain and receiving them on the destination chain
- **`TokenMinter`** - responsible for the actual minting and burning of USDC, utilizing chain-specific settings for both the burners and minters across different networks

The following sections will examine these contracts in-depth, focusing on the methods invoked indirectly through function calls in the Wormhole Circle Integration contract.

!!! note
    When using Wormhole's CCTP integration, you will not directly interact with these contracts. You will indirectly interact with them through the Wormhole Circle Integration contract.

These contracts can be found in [Circle's `evm-cctp-contracts` repository](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/){target=\_blank} on GitHub.

### Token Messenger Contract

The Token Messenger contract enables cross-chain USDC transfers by coordinating message exchanges between blockchains. It works alongside the Message Transmitter contract to relay messages for burning USDC on a source chain and minting it on a destination chain. The contract emits events to track both the burning of tokens and their subsequent minting on the destination chain.

To ensure secure communication, the Token Messenger restricts message handling to registered remote Token Messenger contracts only. It verifies the proper conditions for token burning and manages local and remote minters using chain-specific settings.

Additionally, the contract provides methods for updating or replacing previously sent burn messages, adding or removing remote Token Messenger contracts, and managing the minting process for cross-chain transfers.

The functions provided by the Token Messenger contract are as follows:

- **`depositForBurn`** - deposits and burns tokens from the sender to be minted on the destination domain. Minted tokens will be transferred to `mintRecipient`

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `amount` ++"uint256"++
        
        The amount of tokens to burn.

        ---

        `destinationDomain` ++"uint32"++
        
        The network where the token will be minted after burn.

        ---

        `mintRecipient` ++"bytes32"++
        
        Address of mint recipient on destination domain.

        ---

        `burnToken` ++"address"++
        
        Address of contract to burn deposited tokens, on local domain.

    ??? interface "Returns"

        `_nonce` ++"uint64"++
        
        Unique nonce reserved by message.

    ??? interface "Emits"

        `DepositForBurn` - event emitted when `depositForBurn` is called. The `destinationCaller` is set to `bytes32(0)` to allow any address to call `receiveMessage` on the destination domain

        ??? child "Event Arguments"

    `nonce` ++"uint64"++ 
    
    Unique nonce reserved by message (indexed).

    ---

    `burnToken` ++"address"++ 
    
    Address of token burnt on source domain.

    ---

    `amount` ++"uint256"++
    
    The deposit amount.

    ---

    `depositor` ++"address"++
    
    Address where deposit is transferred from.

    ---

    `mintRecipient` ++"bytes32"++
    
    Address receiving minted tokens on destination domain.

    ---

    `destinationDomain` ++"uint32"++ -
    
    Destination domain.

    ---

    `destinationTokenMessenger` ++"bytes32"++
    
    Address of `TokenMessenger` on destination domain.
    
    ---

    `destinationCaller` ++"bytes32"++
    
    Authorized caller of the `receiveMessage` function on the destination domain, if not equal to `bytes32(0)`. If equal to `bytes32(0)`, any address can call `receiveMessage`.

- **`replaceDepositForBurn`** — replaces a previous `BurnMessage` to modify the mint recipient and/or the destination caller. The replacement message reuses the `_nonce` created by the original message, which allows the original message's sender to update the details without requiring a new deposit

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `originalMessage` ++"bytes"++
        
        The original burn message to be replaced.

    ???+ note

        Though this function can only be called by the local `MessageTransmitter`, it is included here as it emits the essential event for minting tokens and withdrawing to send to the recipient.

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `remoteDomain` ++"uint32"++
        
        The domain where the message originated.

### Message Transmitter Contract

The Message Transmitter contract ensures secure messaging across blockchain domains by managing message dispatch and tracking communication with events like `MessageSent` and `MessageReceived`. It uses a unique nonce for each message, which ensures proper validation, verifies attestation signatures, and prevents replay attacks.

The contract supports flexible delivery options, allowing messages to be sent to a specific `destinationCaller` or broadcast more generally. It also includes domain-specific configurations to manage communication between chains.

Additional features include replacing previously sent messages, setting maximum message body sizes, and verifying that messages are received only once per nonce to maintain network integrity.

### Token Minter Contract

The Token Minter contract manages the minting and burning of tokens across different blockchain domains. It maintains a registry that links local tokens to their corresponding remote tokens, ensuring that tokens maintain a 1:1 exchange rate across domains.

The contract restricts minting and burning functions to a designated Token Messenger, which ensures secure and reliable cross-chain operations. When tokens are burned on a remote domain, an equivalent amount is minted on the local domain for a specified recipient, and vice versa.

To enhance control and flexibility, the contract includes mechanisms to pause operations, set burn limits, and update the Token Controller, which governs token minting permissions. Additionally, it provides functionality to add or remove the local Token Messenger and retrieve the local token address associated with a remote token.

## How to Interact with CCTP Contracts

Before writing your own contracts, it's essential to understand the key functions and events of the Wormhole CCTP contracts. The primary functionality revolves around the following:

- **Sending tokens with a message payload** - initiating a cross-chain transfer of Circle-supported assets along with a message payload to a specific target address on the target chain
- **Receiving tokens with a message payload** - validating messages received from other chains via Wormhole and then minting the tokens for the recipient

### Sending Tokens and Messages

To initiate a cross-chain transfer, you must call the `transferTokensWithPayload` method of Wormhole's Circle Integration (CCTP) contract. Once you have initiated a transfer, you must fetch the attested Wormhole message and parse the transaction logs to locate a transfer message emitted by the Circle Bridge contract. Then, a request must be sent to Circle's off-chain process with the transfer message to grab the attestation from the process's response, which validates the token mint on the target chain.

To streamline this process, you can use the [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/tree/main){target=\_blank}, which exposes the [`WormholeRelayerSDK.sol` contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol){target=\_blank}, including the [`CCTPSender` abstract contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/WormholeRelayer/CCTPBase.sol){target=\_blank}. By inheriting this contract, you can transfer USDC while automatically relaying the message payload to the destination chain via a Wormhole-deployed relayer.

The `CCTPSender` abstract contract exposes the `sendUSDCWithPayloadToEvm` function. This function publishes a CCTP transfer of the provided `amount` of USDC and requests that the transfer be delivered along with a `payload` to the specified `targetAddress` on the `targetChain`.

```solidity
function sendUSDCWithPayloadToEvm(
    uint16 targetChain,
    address targetAddress,
    bytes memory payload,
    uint256 receiverValue,
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 amount
) internal returns (uint64 sequence)
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `targetChain` ++"uint16"++

    The target chain for the transfer.

    ---

    `targetAddress` ++"address"++

    The target address for the transfer.

    ---

    `payload` ++"bytes"++

    Arbitrary payload to be delivered to the target chain via Wormhole.

    ---

    `gasLimit` ++"uint256"++

    The gas limit with which to call `targetAddress`.

    ---

    `amount` ++"uint256"++

    The amount of USDC to transfer.

    ---

??? interface "Returns"

    `sequence` ++"uint64"++

    Sequence number of the published VAA containing the delivery instructions.

When the `sendUSDCWithPayloadToEvm` function is called, the following series of actions are executed:

1. **USDC transfer initiation**:

    - The Circle Token Messenger contract is approved to spend the specified amount of USDC.
    - The `depositForBurnWithCaller` function of the Token Messenger contract is invoked
    - A key is returned, which is to be provided to the Wormhole relayer for message delivery

2. **Message encoding** - the message `payload` is encoded for transmission via the Wormhole relayer. The encoded value also includes the `amount` so that it can be checked on the target chain
3. **Retrieving delivery provider** - the current default delivery provider's address is retrieved
4. **Cost calculation** - the transfer cost is calculated using the Wormhole relayer's `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice` function
5. **Message dispatch**:

    - The `sendToEvm` function of the Wormhole relayer is called with the encoded payload, the delivery provider's address, and the arguments passed to `sendUSDCWithPayloadToEvm`
    - The function must be called with `msg.value` set to the previously calculated cost (from step 4)
    - This function publishes an instruction for the delivery provider to relay the payload and VAAs specified by the key (from step 1) to the target address on the target chain

A simple example implementation is as follows:

```solidity
function sendCrossChainDeposit(
    uint16 targetChain,
    address targetAddress,
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256,
    gasLimit
) public payable {
    uint256 cost = quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain);
    require(
        msg.value == cost,
        "msg.value must be quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain)"
    );

    IERC20(USDC).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    bytes memory payload = abi.encode(recipient);
    sendUSDCWithPayloadToEvm(
        targetChain,
        targetAddress, // address (on targetChain) to send token and payload to
        payload,
        0, // receiver value
        gasLimit,
        amount
    );
}
```

The above example sends a specified amount of USDC and the recipient's address as a payload to a target contract on another chain, ensuring that the correct cost is provided for the cross-chain transfer.

### Receiving Tokens and Messages

To complete the cross-chain transfer, you must invoke the `redeemTokensWithPayload` function on the target Wormhole Circle Integration contract. This function verifies the message's authenticity, decodes the payload, confirms the recipient and sender, checks message delivery, and then calls the `receiveMessage` function of the [Message Transmitter](#message-transmitter-contract) contract.

Using the Wormhole-deployed relayer automatically triggers the `receiveWormholeMessages` function. This function is defined in the [`WormholeRelayerSDK.sol` contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol){target=\_blank} from the [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/tree/main){target=\_blank} and is implemented within the [`CCTPReceiver` abstract contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/WormholeRelayer/CCTPBase.sol){target=\_blank}.

        bytes32 deliveryHash
    ) external payable {
        // Currently, 'sendUSDCWithPayloadToEVM' only sends one CCTP transfer
        // That can be modified if the integrator desires to send multiple CCTP transfers
        // in which case the following code would have to be modified to support
        // redeeming these multiple transfers and checking that their 'amount's are accurate
        require(
            additionalMessages.length <= 1,
            "CCTP: At most one Message is supported"
        );

        if (additionalMessages.length == 1)
            amountUSDCReceived = redeemUSDC(additionalMessages[0]);

        (uint256 amount, bytes memory userPayload) = abi.decode(
            payload,
            (uint256, bytes)
        );

        // Check that the correct amount was received
        // It is important to verify that the 'USDC' sent in by the relayer is the same amount
        // that the sender sent in on the source chain
        require(amount == amountUSDCReceived, "Wrong amount received");

        receivePayloadAndUSDC(
            userPayload,
            amountUSDCReceived,
            sourceAddress,
            sourceChain,
            deliveryHash
        );
    }

    // Implement this function to handle in-bound deliveries that include a CCTP transfer
    function receivePayloadAndUSDC(
        bytes memory payload,
        uint256 amountUSDCReceived,
        bytes32 sourceAddress,
        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32 deliveryHash
    ) internal virtual {}
}
    ```

Although you do not need to interact with the `receiveWormholeMessages` function directly, it's important to understand what it does. This function processes cross-chain messages and USDC transfers via Wormhole's Circle (CCTP) Bridge. Here's a summary of what it does:

1. **Validate additional messages** - the function checks that there is at most one CCTP transfer message in the `additionalMessages` array, as it currently only supports processing a single CCTP transfer
2. **Redeem USDC**:
    - If there is a CCTP message, it calls the `redeemUSDC` function of the `CCTPReceiver` contract to decode and redeem the USDC
    - This results in the call of the `receiveMessage` function of Circle's Message Transmitter contract to redeem the USDC based on the provided message and signature
    - The amount of USDC received is calculated by subtracting the contract's previous balance from the current balance after redeeming the USDC
3. **Decode payload** - the incoming payload is decoded, extracting both the expected amount of USDC and a `userPayload` (which could be any additional data)
4. **Verify the amount** - it ensures that the amount of USDC received matches the amount encoded in the payload. If the amounts don't match, the transaction is reverted
5. **Handle the payload and USDC** - after verifying the amounts, `receivePayloadAndUSDC` is called, which is meant to handle the actual logic for processing the received payload and USDC transfer

You'll need to implement the `receivePayloadAndUSDC` function to transfer the USDC and handle the payload as your application needs. A simple example implementation is as follows:

```solidity
function receivePayloadAndUSDC(
    bytes memory payload,
    uint256 amountUSDCReceived,
    bytes32, // sourceAddress
    uint16, // sourceChain
    bytes32 // deliveryHash
) internal override onlyWormholeRelayer {
    address recipient = abi.decode(payload, (address));

    IERC20(USDC).transfer(recipient, amountUSDCReceived);
}
```

# Configure Your Connect Widget

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Wormhole Connect is a flexible React widget that streamlines cross-chain asset transfers and enables seamless interoperability by leveraging Wormhole's powerful infrastructure. Designed for easy integration into decentralized applications (dApps), Wormhole Connect abstracts the complexities of cross-chain communication, providing a user-friendly experience for both developers and end users.

This guide provides detailed instructions on configuring Wormhole Connect and highlights the many ways it can be customized to fit your specific needs, from integrating supported blockchains and tokens to tailoring the user interface.

!!! note
    For documentation on the latest version of Connect, please refer to the current [configuration documentation](/docs/build/transfers/connect/configuration/){target=\_blank}. If you are looking to upgrade from Wormhole Connect v0 to v1, please refer to the [migration guide](/docs/build/transfers/connect/upgrade/){target=\_blank} for detailed instructions.

## Get Started

Configure the Wormhole Connect React component by passing a `WormholeConnectConfig` object as the `config` attribute. If using the hosted version, provide `config` and `theme` as JSON-serialized strings on the mount point.

=== "React"

    ```ts
    import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';
  
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  networks: ['ethereum', 'polygon', 'solana'],
  tokens: ['ETH', 'WETH', 'MATIC', 'WMATIC'],
  rpcs: {
    ethereum: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth',
    solana: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana',
  }
}
  
<WormholeConnect config={config} />
    ```

=== "HTML Tags"

    ```html
    <div
  id="wormhole-connect"
  data-config='{"tokens":["ETH","WETH","WBTC","USDCeth"]}'
  data-theme='{"background":{"default": "#81c784"}}'
/>
    ```

## Examples {: #examples }

Below are some examples of different ways you can configure Connect. See `WormholeConnectConfig` in the below file for a full view of the supported configuration parameters.

### Custom Networks and RPC Endpoints {: #custom-networks-and-rpc-endpoints }

Specify supported networks, tokens, and custom RPC endpoints. Your users may encounter rate limits using public RPC endpoints if you don't provide your own.

=== "Mainnet"

    ```js
    import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  env: 'mainnet',
  networks: ['ethereum', 'polygon', 'solana'],
  tokens: ['ETH', 'WETH', 'MATIC', 'WMATIC'],
  rpcs: {
    ethereum: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth',
    solana: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana',
  },
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
    ```

=== "Testnet"

    ```js
    import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  env: 'testnet',
  networks: ['sepolia', 'arbitrum_sepolia', 'base_sepolia', 'fuji'],

  rpcs: {
    fuji: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/avalanche_fuji',
    base_sepolia: 'https://base-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com',
  },
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
    ```

!!! note
    For a complete list of testnet chain names that can be manually added, see the [Testnet Chains List](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/fa4ba4bc349a7caada809f209090d79a3c5962fe/tokenRegistry/src/scripts/importConnect.ts#L44-L55){target=\_blank}.

### Fully Customized Theme {: #fully-customized-theme }

Wormhole Connect offers a high level of customizability that suits and integrates with your application's design, including various options for buttons, backgrounds, popovers, fonts, and more. The following example demonstrates a variety of appearance customizations. Remember, if you prefer a visual to aid in designing your widget, you can use the [no code style interface](https://connect-in-style.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank}.

```jsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectTheme,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';
import red from '@mui/material/colors/red';
import lightblue from '@mui/material/colors/lightBlue';
import grey from '@mui/material/colors/grey';
import green from '@mui/material/colors/green';
import orange from '@mui/material/colors/orange';

const customTheme: WormholeConnectTheme = {
  mode: 'dark',
  primary: grey,
  secondary: grey,
  divider: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)',
  background: {
    default: '#232323',
  },
  text: {
    primary: '#ffffff',
    secondary: grey[500],
  },
  error: red,
  info: lightblue,
  success: green,
  warning: orange,
  button: {
    primary: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)',
    primaryText: '#ffffff',
    disabled: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)',
    disabledText: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)',
    action: orange[300],
    actionText: '#000000',
    hover: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)',
  },
  options: {
    hover: '#474747',
    select: '#5b5b5b',
  },
  card: {
    background: '#333333',
    secondary: '#474747',
    elevation: 'none',
  },
  popover: {
    background: '#1b2033',
    secondary: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)',
    elevation: 'none',
  },
  modal: {
    background: '#474747',
  },
  font: {
    primary: 'Impact',
    header: 'Impact',
  },
};

export default function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect theme={customTheme} />;
}
```

### Environment {: #environment }

You can configure Connect to be used in Testnet environments, too. You can toggle between Mainnet and Testnet environments by defining the `WormholeConnectConfig` as follows:

=== "Mainnet"

    ```ts
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      env: 'mainnet',
    };
    ```

=== "Testnet"

    ```ts
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      env: 'testnet',
    };
    ```
### Custom RPC Endpoint {: #custom-rpc-endpoint }

You can define a custom RPC provider for your Connect widget to use. This can be especially helpful if you'd like to replace public endpoints with dedicated or private endpoints.

```ts
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  rpcs: {
    solana: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana/ee827255553bb0fa9e0aaeab27e988707e60ea06ae36be0658b778072e94979e',
  },
};
```

### Arbitrary Token {: #arbitrary-token }

The following section shows how to add an arbitrary token to your deployment of Connect.

!!! note
    You will need to [register](https://portalbridge.com/advanced-tools/#/register){target=\_blank} your token with the Token Bridge to get the contract addresses necessary for it to work with Connect.

This example configuration limits Connect to the Solana and Ethereum networks and a handful of tokens, including `BSKT`, which isn't built in by default and provided under the `tokensConfig` key.

See [`src/config/types.ts`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/development/wormhole-connect/src/config/types.ts){target=\_blank} for the type definition of `TokensConfig`.

```json
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  networks: ['solana', 'ethereum'],
  tokens: ['ETH', 'WETH', 'MATIC', 'WMATIC', 'BSKT'],
  tokensConfig: {
    BSKT: {
      key: 'BSKT',
      symbol: 'BSKT',
      nativeChain: 'solana',
      tokenId: {
        chain: 'solana',
        address: '6gnCPhXtLnUD76HjQuSYPENLSZdG8RvDB1pTLM5aLSJA',
      },
      coinGeckoId: 'basket',
      icon: 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/34661/standard/BSKT_Logo.png?1705636891',
      color: '#2894EE',
      decimals: {
        default: 5,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## More Configuration Options {: #more-configuration-options }

### Whitelisting Tokens {: #whitelisting-tokens }

By default, Connect will offer its complete built-in list of assets, but you can restrict the displayed assets by defining a subset of tokens under `tokens`. The default full list is as follows:

|    Mainnet     |              Testnet               |
|:--------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|      ETH       |          ETH, ETHsepolia           |
|      WETH      |         WETH, WETHsepolia          |
|    USDCeth     |              USDCeth               |
|      WBTC      |                 -                  |

### Routes {: #routes }

By default, Connect will offer its complete built-in list of routes, but you can restrict the possible route assets by defining a subset under `routes.` By default, Connect will offer its complete built-in list:

|   Mainnet    |  Testnet   |
|:------------:|:----------:|
|    bridge    |   bridge   |
|    relay     |   relay    |
|  cctpManual  | cctpManual |

| wstETHBridge |     -      |
|  usdtBridge  |     -      |
|     tBTC     |    tBTC    |

### Wallet Set Up  {: #wallet-connect-project-id }

When using Wormhole Connect, your selected blockchain network determines the available wallet options.

 - For EVM chains, wallets like MetaMask and WalletConnect are supported
 - For Solana, you'll see options such as Phantom, Torus, and Coin98

The wallet options automatically adjust based on the selected chain, providing a seamless user experience without additional configuration.

If you would like to offer WalletConnect as a supported wallet option, you'll need to obtain a project ID on the [WalletConnect cloud dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/){target=\_blank}.

### Toggle Hamburger Menu {: #toggle-hamburger-menu }

By setting the `showHamburgerMenu` option to **false**, you can deactivate the hamburger menu, causing the links to be positioned at the bottom.

#### Add Extra Menu Entry {: #add-extra-menu-entry }

By setting the `showHamburgerMenu` option to `false,` you can add extra links. The following properties are accessed through the `menu[]` property (e.g., `menu[].label`):

| Property |                 Description                 |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
| `label`  |            Link name to show up             |
|  `href`  |              Target URL or URN              |
| `target` | Anchor standard target, by default `_blank` |
| `order`  | Order where the new item should be injected |

#### Sample Configuration {: #sample-configuration }

```json

## Data Configuration

This page explains how to configure Wormhole Connect's core functionality, from choosing supported chains and tokens to bridging routes to setting up wallets and enabling price lookups. By the end, you'll know how to specify custom networks and RPC endpoints, integrate different bridging protocols, add new tokens, and more.

## Get Started

Configure Wormhole Connect by passing a `WormholeConnectConfig` object as the `config` prop.

=== "React integration"

    ```ts
    import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  chains: ['Ethereum', 'Polygon', 'Solana'],
  tokens: ['ETH', 'WETH', 'MATIC', 'WMATIC'],
  rpcs: {
    Ethereum: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth',
    Solana: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana',
  }
}

<WormholeConnect config={config} />
    ```

=== "Hosted integration"

    ```ts
    import WormholeConnect, {
  wormholeConnectHosted,
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  chains: ['Ethereum', 'Polygon', 'Solana'],
  tokens: ['ETH', 'WETH', 'MATIC', 'WMATIC'],
  rpcs: {
    Ethereum: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth',
    Solana: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana',
  },
};

const container = document.getElementById('bridge-container');

wormholeConnectHosted(container, {
  config,
});
    ```

!!! note
    The complete type definition of `WormholeConnectConfig` is available in the [Wormhole Connect repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/development/wormhole-connect/src/config/types.ts){target=\_blank}.

## Examples {: #examples }

### Configuring Chains and RPC Endpoints {: #chains-and-rpc-endpoints }

Connect lets you customize the available chains to match your project's needs. You should provide your own RPC endpoints, as the default public ones may not support essential functions like balance fetching.

=== "Mainnet"

    ```js
    import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  chains: ['Ethereum', 'Polygon', 'Solana'],
  rpcs: {
    Ethereum: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth',
    Solana: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana',
  },
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
    ```

=== "Testnet"

    ```js
    import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  // You can use Connect with testnet chains by specifying "network":
  network: 'Testnet',
  chains: ['Sepolia', 'ArbitrumSepolia', 'BaseSepolia', 'Avalanche'],
  rpcs: {
    Avalanche: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/avalanche_fuji',
    BaseSepolia: 'https://base-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com',
  },
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
    ```

!!! note
    For a complete list of available chain names, see the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/base/src/constants/chains.ts){target=\_blank}.

### Configuring Routes

By default, Connect offers two bridging protocols: Token Bridge (for Wormhole-wrapped tokens) and Circle's CCTP (for native USDC). For most use cases, integrators require more than these default routes. The `routes` property allows you to specify which protocols to include and exclude any routes unnecessary for your application, including default and third-party routes.

#### Available Route Plugins

The `@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect` package offers a variety of `route` plugins to give you flexibility in handling different protocols. You can choose from the following `route` exports for your integration:

- [**`TokenBridgeRoute`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/connect/src/routes/tokenBridge/manual.ts){target=\_blank} - manually redeemed Wormhole Token Bridge route
- [**`AutomaticTokenBridgeRoute`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/connect/src/routes/tokenBridge/automatic.ts){target=\_blank} - automatically redeemed (relayed) Token Bridge route
- [**`CCTPRoute`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/connect/src/routes/cctp/manual.ts){target=\_blank} - manually redeemed CCTP route
- [**`AutomaticCCTPRoute`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/connect/src/routes/cctp/automatic.ts){target=\_blank} - automatically redeemed (relayed) CCTP route
- **`DEFAULT_ROUTES`** - array containing the four preceding routes (`TokenBridgeRoute`, `AutomaticTokenBridgeRoute`, `CCTPRoute`, `AutomaticCCTPRoute`)
- [**`nttAutomaticRoute(nttConfig)`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/sdk/route/src/automatic.ts){target=\_blank} - function that returns the automatically-redeemed (relayed) Native Token Transfer (NTT) route
- [**`nttManualRoute(nttConfig)`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/sdk/route/src/manual.ts){target=\_blank}- function that returns the manually-redeemed NTT route
- **`nttRoutes(nttConfig)`** - function that returns both NTT routes as an array
- [**`MayanRoute`**](https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route/blob/main/src/index.ts#L57){target=\_blank} - route that offers multiple Mayan protocols
- [**`MayanRouteSWIFT`**](https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route/blob/main/src/index.ts#L528){target=\_blank} - route for Mayan's Swift protocol only
- [**`MayanRouteMCTP`**](https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route/blob/main/src/index.ts#L539){target=\_blank} - route for Mayan's MCTP protocol only
- [**`MayanRouteWH`**](https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route/blob/main/src/index.ts#L550){target=\_blank} - route for Mayan's original Wormhole transfer protocol

In addition to these routes, developers can create custom routes for their Wormhole-based protocols. For examples, refer to the [NTT](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/tree/main/sdk/route){target=\_blank} and the [Mayan](https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route){target=\_blank} example GitHub repositories.

For further details on the `route` plugin interface, refer to the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK route code](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/connect/src/routes/route.ts){target=\_blank}.

#### Example: Offer Only CCTP Transfers

To configure Wormhole Connect to offer only USDC transfers via the CCTP route, use the following configuration:

```typescript
import WormholeConnect, {
  AutomaticCCTPRoute,
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  routes: [AutomaticCCTPRoute],
};

<WormholeConnect config={config} />;
```

#### Example: Offer All Default Routes and Third-Party Plugins

In this example, Wormhole Connect is configured with routes for both default protocols (Token Bridge and CCTP), as well as third-party protocols like [Native Token Transfers (NTT)](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/){target=\_blank} and [Mayan Swap](https://swap.mayan.finance/){target=\_blank}.

```typescript
import WormholeConnect, {
  DEFAULT_ROUTES,
  nttRoutes,
  MayanRouteSWIFT,
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

import { myNttConfig } from './consts'; // Custom NTT configuration

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  routes: [...DEFAULT_ROUTES, ...nttRoutes(myNttConfig), MayanRouteSWIFT],
};

<WormholeConnect config={config} />;
```

This flexible plugin allows you to combine default routes (such as Token Bridge and CCTP) with third-party protocols, offering complete control over which routes are available in your application.

### Adding Custom Tokens {: #custom-tokens }

The following section shows how to add an arbitrary token to your deployment of Connect.

!!! note
    You will need to [register](https://portalbridge.com/advanced-tools/#/register){target=\_blank} your token with the Token Bridge to get the contract addresses necessary for it to work with that protocol.

This example configuration adds the BONK token to Connect. Note the `wrappedTokens` property, which is required for use with the Token Bridge.

See the [Connect source code](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/development/wormhole-connect/src/config/types.ts){target=\_blank} for the type definition of `TokensConfig`.

```typescript
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  tokensConfig: {
    BONK: {
      key: 'BONK',
      symbol: 'BONK',
      nativeChain: 'Ethereum',
      icon: Icon.ETH,
      tokenId: {
        chain: 'Ethereum',
        address: '0x1151CB3d861920e07a38e03eEAd12C32178567F6',
      },
      coinGeckoId: 'bonk',
      decimals: 18,
    },
  },
  wrappedTokens: {
    BONK: {
      Solana: 'DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263',
    },
  },
};
```

### Whitelisting Tokens {: #whitelisting-tokens }

Connect offers a list of built-in tokens by default. You can see it below:

- [Mainnet tokens](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/development/wormhole-connect/src/config/mainnet/tokens.ts){target=\_blank}
- [Testnet tokens](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/development/wormhole-connect/src/config/testnet/tokens.ts){target=\_blank}

You can customize the tokens shown in the UI using the `tokens` property. The following example adds a custom token and limits Connect to showing only that token, along with the native gas tokens ETH and SOL.

```jsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  chains: ['Ethereum', 'Solana'],
  tokens: ['ETH', 'SOL', 'BONK'],
  rpcs: {
    Ethereum: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/eth',
    Solana: 'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana',
  },
  tokensConfig: {
    BONK: {
      key: 'BONK',
      symbol: 'BONK',
      icon: 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28600/large/bonk.jpg?1696527587',
      tokenId: {
        chain: 'Ethereum',
        address: '0x1151CB3d861920e07a38e03eEAd12C32178567F6',
      },
      decimals: 18,
    },
  },
  wrappedTokens: {
    BONK: {
      Solana: 'DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263',
    },
  },
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
```

You can whitelist tokens by symbol or by specifying tuples of [chain, address]. For example, this would show only BONK token (on all chains you've whitelisted) as well as [`EPjFW...TDt1v`](https://solscan.io/token/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v){target=\_blank} on Solana, which is USDC.

```jsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  chains: ['Ethereum', 'Solana'],
  tokens: [
    // Whitelist BONK on every whitelisted chain
    'BONK',
    // Also whitelist USDC, specifically on Solana
    ['Solana', 'EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v']
  ],
  ...
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
```

### User-Inputted Tokens {: #user-inputted-tokens }

As of version 2.0, Connect allows users to paste token addresses to bridge any token they want. As an integrator, you may want to disable this feature if you are deploying Connect for use only with a specific token(s).

If you provide a token whitelist (see above), this is turned off automatically. However, you can also disable it explicitly like this:

```jsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  ui: {
    disableUserInputtedTokens: true
  }
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
```

Setting `ui.disableUserInputtedTokens` to `true` will disable the ability to paste in token addresses.

### Transaction Settings {: #transaction-settings }

Landing transactions on Solana can require finely tuned priority fees when there is congestion. You can tweak how Connect determines these with `transactionSettings`. All of the parameters in this configuration are optional; you can provide any combination of them.

```jsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  transactionSettings: {
    Solana: {
      priorityFee: {
        // Number between 0-1, defaults to 0.9. Higher percentile yields higher fees.
        // For example, you can set percentile to 0.95 to make Connect compute the
        // 95th percentile priority fee amount based on recent transactions
        percentile: 0.95,

        // Any number, defaults to 1.0. The fee amount is multiplied by this number.
        // This can be used to further raise or lower the fees Connect is using.
        // For example, percentile=0.95 and percentileMultiple=1.1 would use
        // the 95th percentile fee, with a 10% increase
        percentileMultiple: 1.1,

        // Minimum fee you want to use in microlamports, regardless of recent transactions
        // Defaults to 1
        min: 200_000,

        // Maximum fee you want to use in microlamports, regardless of recent transactions
        // Defaults to 100,000,000
        max: 5_000_000,
      }
    }
  }
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
```

!!! note
    Connect can calculate fees more accurately if you are using a [Triton](https://triton.one){target=\_blank} RPC endpoint.

### Wallet Set Up  {: #reown-cloud-project-id }

Your selected blockchain network determines the available wallet options when using Wormhole Connect.

 - For EVM chains, wallets like MetaMask and Reown Cloud (formerly WalletConnect) are supported
 - For Solana, you'll see options such as Phantom, Torus, and Coin98

The wallet options automatically adjust based on the selected chain, providing a seamless user experience without additional configuration.

If you would like to offer Reown Cloud (formerly WalletConnect) as a supported wallet option, you'll need to obtain a project ID on the [Reown Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.reown.com/){target=\_blank}.

### CoinGecko API Key {: #coingecko-api-key }

The CoinGecko API can be used to fetch token price data. If you have a [CoinGecko API Plan](https://apiguide.coingecko.com/getting-started/getting-started){target=\_blank}, you can include the API key in the configuration.

```jsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  coinGeckoApiKey: 'INSERT_API_KEY',
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
```

## Theme & UI Customization

This page focuses on how to style the Wormhole Connect widget, covering color schemes, fonts, layout changes (like toggling the hamburger menu), and adding extra menu entries. You'll learn how to customize Connect's look and feel to match your application's branding.

### Changing the Color Scheme

You can customize Connect's color scheme by providing a `theme` prop.

=== "React integration"

    ```ts
    import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
  WormholeConnectTheme,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  /* Your config... */
};

const theme: WormholeConnectTheme = {
  mode: 'dark',
  primary: '#78c4b6',
  font: 'Comic Sans; sans-serif',
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} theme={theme} />;
}
    ```

=== "Hosted integration"

    ```ts
    import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
  WormholeConnectTheme,
  wormholeConnectHosted,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  /* Your config... */
};

const theme: WormholeConnectTheme = {
  mode: 'dark',
  primary: '#78c4b6',
  font: 'Comic Sans; sans-serif',
};

const container = document.getElementById('bridge-container');

wormholeConnectHosted(container, {
  config,
  theme,
});
    ```

The `WormholeConnectTheme` type supports the following properties:

| <div style="width:10em">Property</div> |                              Description                              |        Example        |
|:--------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|                 `mode`                 |                 Dark mode or light mode. **Required**                 | `"dark"` or `"light"` |
|                `input`                 |                Color used for input fields, dropdowns                 |      `"#AABBCC"`      |
|               `primary`                |                    Primary color used for buttons                     |      `"#AABBCC"`      |
|              `secondary`               |               Secondary color used for some UI elements               |      `"#AABBCC"`      |
|                 `text`                 |                      Primary color used for text                      |      `"#AABBCC"`      |
|            `textSecondary`             |                 Secondary color used for dimmer text                  |      `"#AABBCC"`      |
|                `error`                 |         Color to display errors in, usually some shade of red         |      `"#AABBCC"`      |
|               `success`                |                 Color to display success messages in                  |      `"#AABBCC"`      |
|                 `font`                 | Font used in the UI, can be custom font available in your application | `"Arial; sans-serif"` |

### Toggle Hamburger Menu {: #toggle-hamburger-menu }

By setting the `showHamburgerMenu` option to **false**, you can deactivate the hamburger menu, which will position the links at the bottom.

#### Add Extra Menu Entry {: #add-extra-menu-entry }

By setting the `showHamburgerMenu` option to `false,` you can add extra links. The following properties are accessed through the `menu[]` property (e.g., `menu[].label`):

| Property |                 Description                 |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
| `label`  |            Link name to show up             |
|  `href`  |              Target URL or URN              |
| `target` | Anchor standard target, by default `_blank` |
| `order`  | Order where the new item should be injected |

```jsx
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  ui: {
    showHamburgerMenu: false,
    menu: [
      {
        label: 'Advance Tools',
        href: 'https://portalbridge.com',
        target: '_self',
        order: 1,
      },
    ],
  },
};

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
}
```

description: Common questions and detailed answers about using Wormhole Connect, including supported assets, chains, customization, and integration options.
---

# Wormhole Connect FAQs

## What types of assets does Connect support? 

Wormhole Connect supports both native and wrapped assets across all Wormhole-supported blockchains. This includes:

 - Major stablecoins like USDT and USDC (via CCTP)
 - Native gas tokens such as ETH, SOL, etc.
 - Cross-chain asset swaps through integrators like Mayan

When bridging assets through the Wormhole Token Bridge, depending on the chain and token, assets may arrive as Wormhole-wrapped tokens on the destination chain.

## What chains does Connect support? 

Connect supports around 30 chains, spanning various blockchain runtimes:

 - EVM-based chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, BSC, etc.)
 - Solana
 - Move-based chains (Sui, Aptos)

For a complete list of supported chains, see the [Connect-supported chains list](/docs/build/transfers/connect/features/){target=\_blank}.

## What is gas dropoff? 

Gas dropoff allows users to receive gas for transaction fees on the destination chain, eliminating the need to acquire the native gas token from a centralized exchange. The relayer automatically swaps part of the transferred assets into the native gas token, enabling seamless entry into new ecosystems.

## Can I customize Connect inside my application?

Connect can be [fully customized](https://connect-in-style.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank} to choose the chains and assets you wish to support. You may also select different themes and colors to tailor Connect for your decentralized application. For details, see the [GitHub readme](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect){target=\_blank}.

## Which functions or events does Connect rely on for NTT integration? 

Connect relies on the NTT SDK for integration, with platform-specific implementations for Solana and EVM. The critical methods involved include initiate and redeem functions and rate capacity methods. These functions ensure Connect can handle token transfers and manage chain-rate limits.

## Do integrators need to enable wallets like Phantom or Backpack in Wormhole Connect?

Integrators don’t need to explicitly enable wallets like Phantom or Backpack in Wormhole Connect. However, the wallet must be installed and enabled in the user's browser to appear as an option in the interface.

## Which function should be modified to set priority fees for Solana transactions?

In [Wormhole Connect](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect){target=\_blank}, you can modify the priority fees for Solana transactions by updating the `computeBudget/index.ts` file. This file contains the logic for adjusting the compute unit limit and priority fees associated with Solana transactions.

To control the priority fee applied to your transactions, you can modify the `feePercentile` and `minPriorityFee` parameters in the `addComputeBudget` and `determineComputeBudget` functions.

The relevant file can be found in the Connect codebase: [`computeBudget/index.ts`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/blob/62f1ba8ee5502ac6fd405680e6b3816c9aa54325/sdk/src/contexts/solana/utils/computeBudget/index.ts){target=\_blank}.

## Is there a minimum amount for bridging with CCTP or the Connect SDK?

There is no minimum amount for bridging via CCTP if the user covers the gas fees on both the source and destination chains. However, if the transfer is automatically relayed, a minimum amount is required to cover relay fees on the destination chain. The relay provider charges these fees at cost.

Current relay fees:

- Ethereum L1: ~4.2 USDC
- Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche: 0.3 USDC

Additional notes:

- **USDC to Solana** - Wormhole's native CCTP route does not currently support automatic relaying of USDC to Solana. However, you can transfer USDC to Solana using the [Mayan plugin](https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route){target=\_blank} for the SDK. Mayan is a protocol that integrates Wormhole and CCTP to enable this functionality
- **Frontend integrations**
    - **Connect** - A pre-built UI available via [@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect){target=\_blank}
    - **TypeScript SDK** - A lower-level integration option, available via [@wormhole-foundation/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/sdk){target=\_blank}, allowing developers to build custom UIs

        !!!note
            The TypeScript SDK was previously referred to as the "Connect SDK," but this naming has since been discontinued.

## Feature Explanation {: #feature-explanation}

### Token Bridge {: #token-bridge}

Wormhole is best known for its Token Bridge transfer method. It locks assets on the source chain and mints Wormhole-wrapped "IOU" tokens on the destination chain. To transfer the assets back, the Wormhole-wrapped tokens are burned, unlocking the tokens on their original chain.

This route appears if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

 - Both the origin and destination chains support Token Bridge 
 - No non-Token Bridge routes are available for the selected token

### Token Bridge Relayer {: #token-bridge-relayer}

On the [routes](/docs/build/transfers/connect/routes/){target=\_blank} page, this is referred to as the automatic route in the Token Bridge section.

Trustless relayers can execute the second transaction on behalf of the user, so the user only needs to perform one transaction on the origin chain to have the tokens delivered to the destination automatically—for a small fee.

This route appears if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- Both the origin and destination chains support Token Bridge
- Both the origin and destination chains support Token Bridge relayer
- No non-Token Bridge routes are available for the selected token
- The relayer supports the selected token on the origin chain

### Circle CCTP {: #circle-cctp}

[Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/){target=\_blank}, the issuer of USDC, provides a native way for native USDC to be transferred between [CCTP-enabled](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol){target=\_blank} chains.

This route appears if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- Both the origin and destination chains support Circle CCTP
- The selected token is native Circle-issued USDC

### ETH Bridge {: #eth-bridge}

[Powered by Uniswap liquidity pools](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-uniswap-liquidity-layer){target=\_blank}, this route can transfer native ETH or wstETH between certain EVMs without going through the native bridges.

This route appears if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- Both the origin and destination chains support the ETH Bridge
- The selected token is native ETH, wstETH, or canonical wETH

### Gas Drop Off {: #gas-drop-off}

A relayer can drop off some gas tokens on the destination chain by swapping some of the assets transferred to the native gas token. This is useful if the user wishes to transfer assets to a chain where they don't already have gas. This way, they don't need to onboard into the ecosystem from a centralized exchange.

This route appears if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- Both the origin and destination chains support gas drop off
- An automatic route is selected
- The relayer accepts the selected token to swap into the gas token

# Wormhole Connect

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Wormhole Connect is a React widget that lets developers offer an easy-to-use interface to facilitate cross-chain asset transfers via Wormhole directly in a web application. Check out the [Wormhole Connect GitHub repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect){target=\_blank}.

The [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/reference/sdk-docs){target=\_blank} allows you to implement the same functionality as the Connect widget but in your own UI. Check out the docs for more information on using the SDK instead of Connect.

## Features {: #features }

Wormhole Connect is easy to customize to suit your application's needs. You can specify technical details like supported assets and custom RPCs or forgo customization and have a full-featured widget. The widget UI is highly customizable, with extensive styling options available, including a user-friendly no code styling interface for those who prefer a more visual approach to design. The features of Wormhole Connect include:

- Multiple ways to bridge assets ([routes](/docs/build/transfers/connect/routes/){target=\_blank})
- Extensive ways to style the UI (including the [no code styling interface](https://connect-in-style.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank})
- Ways to [configure](/docs/build/transfers/connect/configuration/){target=\_blank} what feature set to offer
- Ability to configure any token to bridge via Wormhole
- [Ability to drop off some gas](/docs/build/transfers/connect/features/){target=\_blank} at the destination

For more details about the features of Wormhole Connect and a breakdown of supported features by chain, be sure to check [the features page](/docs/build/transfers/connect/features/){target=\_blank}.

## Integrate Connect {: #integrate-connect }

### Import Directly into a React App  {: #import-directly-into-a-react-app}

First, install the Wormhole Connect npm package. You can read more about the package by clicking on the following button: [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect){target=\_blank} 

```bash
npm i @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect
```

Now you can import the React component:

```ts
import WormholeConnect from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

function App() {
  return <WormholeConnect />;
}
```

### Use Hosted Version via CDN {: #use-hosted-version-via-cdn}

If you're not using React, you can still embed Connect on your website by using the hosted version. This uses pre-built packages (which include React) served from NPM by jsdelivr.net.

```ts title="v1.x"
import { wormholeConnectHosted } from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

// Existing DOM element where you want to mount Connect
const container = document.getElementById('bridge-container');

wormholeConnectHosted(container);
```

For help migrating from Connect v0.x to v1.x, see the [v1 Migration](/docs/build/transfers/connect/upgrade/){target=\_blank} guide.

???- code "v0.x"
    Simply copy and paste the following into your HTML body, and replace the ```INSERT_WORMHOLE_CONNECT_VERSION``` in the links with the most recent production version of Wormhole Connect. You can check what the most recent version is on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/v/latest){target=\_blank}.

    ```html
    <!-- Mounting point. Include in <body> -->
<div id="wormhole-connect"></div>

<!-- Dependencies -->
<script
	type="module"
	src="https://www.unpkg.com/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect@INSERT_WORMHOLE_CONNECT_VERSION/dist/main.js"
	defer
></script>
<link
	rel="https://www.unpkg.com/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect@INSERT_WORMHOLE_CONNECT_VERSION/dist/main.css"
/>
    ```

    For example, for [0.3.13](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/v/0.3.13){target=\_blank}:

    ```html
    <!-- Mounting point. Include in <body> -->
<div id="wormhole-connect"></div>

<!-- Dependencies -->
<script
	type="module"
	src="https://www.unpkg.com/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect@0.3.13/dist/main.js"
	defer
></script>
<link
	rel="https://www.unpkg.com/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect@0.3.13/dist/main.css"
/>
    ```

It is important to periodically update your Wormhole Connect instance to the latest version, as there are frequent functionality and security releases.

## Configuration {: #configuration}

This is just an overview of what's possible. Check the [Configuration docs](/docs/build/transfers/connect/configuration/){target=\_blank} for details about all the configuration options.

The default configuration of Wormhole Connect may not be exactly what you're looking for. You may want to:

 - Use custom styles 
 - Restrict the chains that you allow in your app
 - Add support for your project's token, and eliminate tokens you don't want to reduce noise
 - Configuring custom RPC URLs (This is highly recommended as default public RPCs are heavily throttled)
 - Restrict the [routes](/docs/build/transfers/connect/routes/){target=\_blank} that are available

For additional information on the preceding options, check the [configuration options](/docs/build/transfers/connect/configuration/){target=\_blank} and customize your widget however you like.

title: Routes
description: Explore Wormhole Connect's routing capabilities for asset transfers, featuring Token Bridge, CCTP, NTT, and various blockchain-specific routes for optimal UX. 
---

## Routes Overview {: #routes-overview}

This page explains the concept of routes in Wormhole Connect. To configure routes for your widget, check the [Wormhole Connect Configuration](/docs/build/transfers/connect/configuration/){target=\_blank}.

Routes are methods by which the widget will transfer the assets. Wormhole Connect supports Token Bridge transfers for any arbitrary token, and for specific tokens, it also supports more advanced transfer methods that provide superior UX.

When you select the source chain, source token, and destination chain, Wormhole Connect will display the best routes available for that particular combination. In practice, if routes other than the Token Bridge are available, only those will be displayed. Check the [feature matrix](/docs/build/transfers/connect/features/){target=\_blank} to see under which exact conditions the routes appear.

## Token Bridge Routes {: #token-bridge-routes}

The Token Bridge is Wormhole's best-known transfer method. It locks assets on the source chain and mints Wormhole-wrapped "IOU" tokens on the destination chain. To transfer the assets back, the Wormhole-wrapped tokens are burned, unlocking the tokens on their original chain.

#### Manual Route {: #manual-route}

The manual route transfer method requires two transactions: one on the origin chain to lock the tokens (or burn the Wormhole-wrapped tokens) and one on the destination chain to mint the Wormhole-wrapped tokens (or unlock the original tokens). To offer this option, enable the `bridge` route in the configuration.

#### Automatic Route {: #automatic-route}

Trustless relayers can execute the second transaction on the user's behalf, so the user only needs to perform one transaction on the origin chain to have the tokens delivered to the destination automatically - for a small fee. Wormhole Connect automatically detects whether the relayer supports a token and will display the option if the `relay` route is enabled in the configuration.

## CCTP Routes (USDC) {: #cctp-routes-usdc}
 
[Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/){target=\_blank}, the issuer of USDC, provides a native way for native USDC to be transferred between [CCTP-enabled](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol){target=\_blank} chains. Wormhole Connect can facilitate such transfers.

Note that if native USDC is transferred from the CCTP-enabled chains to any other outside of this list, the transfer will be routed through the Token Bridge, and the resulting asset will be a Wormhole-wrapped token instead of native USDC.

#### Manual Route {: #manual-route-cctp}

This transfer method requires two transactions: one on the origin chain to burn the USDC and one on the destination chain to mint the USDC. The manual CCTP route relies on CCTP only and doesn't use Wormhole messaging in the background. Enable the `cctpManual` route in the configuration to offer this option.

#### Automatic Route {: #automatic-route-cctp}

Trustless relayers can execute the second transaction on the user's behalf. Therefore, the user only needs to perform one transaction on the origin chain to have the tokens delivered to the destination automatically—for a small fee. To offer this option, enable the `cctpRelay` route in the configuration.

## Native Token Transfers (NTT) Routes {: #native-token-transfers-ntt-routes}

[Wormhole's Native Token Transfer (NTT) framework](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/){target=\_blank} enables token issuers to retain full ownership of their tokens across any number of chains, unlike the Token Bridge. The token issuer must deploy NTT contracts, and Wormhole Connect needs to be [configured](/docs/build/transfers/connect/configuration/){target=\_blank} with the appropriate `nttGroups` before such tokens are recognized as transferrable via NTT. Refer to the [documentation in the NTT repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers?tab=readme-ov-file#overview){target=\_blank} for more information about the contracts needed and the framework in general.

#### Manual Route {: #manual-route-ntt}

This transfer method requires two transactions: one on the origin chain to burn or lock the tokens and one on the destination chain to mint them. To offer this option, enable the `nttManual` route in the configuration.

#### Automatic Route  {: #automatic-route-ntt}

Trustless relayers can execute the second transaction on the user's behalf, so the user only needs to perform one transaction on the origin chain to have the tokens delivered to the destination automatically—for a small fee. Wormhole Connect automatically detects whether the relayer supports a token and will display the option if the `nttRelay` route is enabled in the configuration.

## ETH Bridge Route for Native ETH and wstETH {: #eth-bridge-route-for-native-eth-and-wsteth}

[Powered by Uniswap liquidity pools](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-uniswap-liquidity-layer){target=\_blank}, this route can transfer native ETH or wstETH between certain EVMs without going through the native bridges. For example, you can transfer native ETH from Arbitrum to Optimism and end up with Optimism ETH all in one go. Supported chains are Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon (canonical wETH), BSC (canonical wETH), and Avalanche (canonical wETH).

#### Automatic Route {: #automatic-route-eth}

Only the relayed route is available due to the complexity of the transaction that needs to be executed at the destination. To offer this option, enable the `ethBridge` and/or `wstETHBridge` route in the configuration to provide this option.

## USDT Bridge Route {: #usdt-bridge-route}

Operating on the same technology as the ETH Bridge, this route can transfer USDT between certain EVMs without going through the native bridges. The resulting token will be the canonical USDT token on the destination instead of the Wormhole-wrapped variant. Supported chains are Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, BSC, and Base.

#### Automatic Route {: #automatic-route-usdt}

Only the relayed route is available due to the complexity of the transaction that needs to be executed on the destination. Enable the `usdtBridge` route in the configuration to offer this option.

## tBTC Route {: #tbtc-route}

You can bridge [Threshold's Bitcoin](https://threshold.network/){target=\_blank} via this hybrid solution that combines the Token Bridge and Threshold's contracts. Native tBTC is first locked in the Wormhole Token Bridge, transferred to the destination in the form of Wormhole-wrapped tBTC, which is then immediately locked in Threshold's contract that mints native tBTC for it. The net result is that the user ends up with native tBTC on chains where this Threshold contract is deployed (e.g., Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base).

Note that if native tBTC is transferred out of these chains to any other outside of this list, the transfer will be routed through the Token Bridge, and the resulting asset will be a Wormhole-wrapped token instead of native tBTC.

#### Manual Route {: #manual-route-tbtc}

This transfer method requires two transactions: one on the origin chain to burn or lock the tokens and one on the destination chain to mint them. To provide this option, enable the `tbtc` route in the configuration.

# Wormhole Connect v1.0 Migration Guide

## Overview

The Wormhole Connect feature has been updated to **version 1.0**, introducing a modernized design and improved routing for faster native-to-native token transfers. This stable release comes with several breaking changes in how to configure the application, requiring minor updates to your integration.

This guide will help you migrate to the new version in just a few simple steps. By following this migration guide, you'll learn how to:

 - Update to the latest Connect package
 - Apply configuration changes to the **`WormholeConnectConfig`** object
 - Understand new routing capabilities and plugin options

These updates ensure better performance and a smoother integration experience.

For complete documentation on the previous version of Wormhole Connect, please refer to the [Wormhole Connect guide](/docs/build/transfers/connect/){target=\_blank}.

## Update the Connect Package

To begin the migration process, update the Wormhole Connect [**npm package**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect/v/1.0.0-beta.6-development?activeTab=readme){target=\_blank} to the latest version 1.0. Updating to the latest version provides access to the newest features and improvements, including the modernized design and enhanced routing capabilities.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect@^1.0
```

This command installs the latest stable version of Wormhole Connect and prepares your environment for the new configuration changes.

## Update the `WormholeConnectConfig` Object

In version 1.0, the `WormholeConnectConfig` object underwent several breaking changes. Most of these changes are minor and can be applied quickly. Below is a summary of the key changes, followed by detailed examples.

### Summary of Breaking Changes

- Chain names are now capitalized: `solana` → `Solana`
- `env` renamed to `network` and is now capitalized: `mainnet` → `Mainnet`
- `networks` renamed to `chains`, with capitalized names
- `routes` updated to use route plugins
- `nttGroups` removed in favor of route plugin configuration
- `tokensConfig` updated, with a new key `wrappedTokens` added
- Many UI-related properties consolidated under a top-level `ui` key
- `customTheme` and `mode` were removed, replaced by a top-level `theme` property

These changes are explained in more detail below, with examples for easy reference.

### Capitalize Chain Names

In version 1.0, chain names are now consistent with the `Chain` type from the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank}, and must be capitalized. This affects all config properties where a chain is referenced, including `rpcs`, `rest`, `graphql`, and `chains`.

=== "v0.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      rpcs: {
        ethereum: 'INSERT_ETH_RPC_URL',
        solana: 'INSERT_SOLANA_RPC_URL',
      },
    };
    ```
=== "v1.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      rpcs: {
        Ethereum: 'INSERT_ETH_RPC_URL',
        Solana: 'INSERT_SOLANA_RPC_URL',
      },
    };
    ```

You can find the complete list of supported chain names in the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/fa4ba4bc349a7caada809f209090d79a3c5962fe/core/base/src/constants/chains.ts#L12-L66){target=\_blank}.

### Rename `env` to `network`

The `env` property has been renamed to `network`, with capitalized values. This change affects how you configure Testnet and Mainnet environments.

=== "v0.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      env: 'testnet',
    };
    ```
=== "v1.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      network: 'Testnet',
    };
    ```

If you don’t explicitly set the `network` value, Connect will default to `Mainnet`.

```typescript
// Defaults to Mainnet
const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {};
```

For more information, refer to the [network constants list](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/core/base/src/constants/networks.ts){target=\_blank}.

### Rename `networks` to `chains`

The `networks` property, which allowed whitelisting chains, is now renamed `chains`, and the chain names are capitalized.

=== "v0.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      networks: ['solana', 'ethereum'],
    };
    ```
=== "v1.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      chains: ['Solana', 'Ethereum'],
    };
    ```

### Update `routes` to Use Route Plugins

The `routes` property in Wormhole Connect version 1.0 has significantly improved. Previously, `routes` was a simple array of strings. The latest version has been transformed into a flexible plugin system, allowing you to include specific routes for various protocols.

By default, if no `routes` property is set, Wormhole Connect will provide routes for two core protocols:

 - [Wormhole Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/){target=\_blank}
 - [CCTP](/docs/learn/transfers/cctp/){target=\_blank}

For most use cases, integrators require more than the default routes. The new `routes` property allows you to specify which protocols to include and exclude any routes unnecessary for your application, including both default and third-party routes.

#### Available `route` Plugins

The `@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect` package offers a variety of `route` plugins to give you flexibility in handling different protocols. You can choose from the following `route` exports for your integration:

???- tip "`route` Plugins"
    - **`TokenBridgeRoute`** - manually redeemed Wormhole Token Bridge route
    - **`AutomaticTokenBridgeRoute`** - automatically redeemed (relayed) Token Bridge route
    - **`CCTPRoute`** - manually redeemed CCTP route
    - **`AutomaticCCTPRoute`** - automatically redeemed (relayed) CCTP route
    - **`DEFAULT_ROUTES`** - array containing the four preceding routes (TokenBridgeRoute, AutomaticTokenBridgeRoute, CCTPRoute, AutomaticCCTPRoute)
    - **`nttAutomaticRoute(nttConfig)`** - function that returns the automatically-redeemed (relayed) Native Token Transfer (NTT) route
    - **`nttManualRoute(nttConfig)`** - function that returns the manually-redeemed NTT route
    - **`nttRoutes(nttConfig)`** - function that returns both NTT routes as an array
    - **`MayanRoute`** - route that offers multiple Mayan protocols
    - **`MayanRouteSWIFT`** - route for Mayan’s Swift protocol only
    - **`MayanRouteMCTP`** - route for Mayan’s MCTP protocol only
    - **`MayanRouteWH`** - route for Mayan’s original Wormhole transfer protocol

In addition to these routes, developers can create custom routes for their own Wormhole-based protocols. For examples, refer to the [NTT](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/tree/main/sdk/route){target=\_blank} and the [Mayan](https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route){target=\_blank} example GitHub repositories.

For further details on the Route plugin interface, refer to the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK route code](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/main/connect/src/routes/route.ts){target=\_blank}.

Now that you know the available `route` plugins, let's explore some examples of configuring them.

#### Example: Offer Only CCTP Transfers

To configure Wormhole Connect to offer only USDC transfers via the CCTP route, use the following configuration:

```typescript
import WormholeConnect, {
  AutomaticCCTPRoute,
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  routes: [AutomaticCCTPRoute],
};

<WormholeConnect config={config} />;
```

#### Example: Offer All Default Routes and Third-Party Plugins

In this example, Wormhole Connect is configured with routes for both default protocols (Token Bridge & CCTP), as well as third-party protocols like [Native Token Transfers (NTT)](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/){target=\_blank} and [Mayan Swap](https://swap.mayan.finance/){target=\_blank}.

```typescript
import WormholeConnect, {
  DEFAULT_ROUTES,
  nttRoutes,
  MayanRouteSWIFT,
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

import { myNttConfig } from './consts'; // Custom NTT configuration

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  routes: [...DEFAULT_ROUTES, ...nttRoutes(myNttConfig), MayanRouteSWIFT],
};

<WormholeConnect config={config} />;
```

This flexible plugin allows you to combine default routes (such as Token Bridge and CCTP) with third-party protocols, offering complete control over which routes are available in your application.

### Update the `tokensConfig` Structure

In Wormhole Connect version 1.0, the `tokensConfig` property has been updated to simplify the structure and improve flexibility for token handling across chains. The previous configuration has been streamlined, and a new key, `wrappedTokens,` has been introduced to handle foreign assets more effectively.

Key Changes to `tokensConfig`:

 - **Capitalized chain names** - all chain names, like `ethereum`, must now be capitalized, such as `Ethereum`, to maintain consistency with the rest of the Wormhole SDK
 - **`wrappedTokens`** - this new key replaces `foreignAssets` and defines the wrapped token addresses on foreign chains, making it easier to manage cross-chain transfers. It consolidates the wrapped token addresses into a cleaner structure. These addresses must be specified to enable token transfers to and from the foreign chain via token bridge routes
 - **Simplified decimals** - instead of using a map of decimal values for different chains, you now only need to provide a single decimals value for the token's native chain

=== "v0.x"

    In the old structure, the `foreignAssets` field defined the token’s presence on other chains, and `decimals` were mapped across multiple chains.

    ```typescript
    import WormholeConnect, {
      WormholeConnectConfig,
    } from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      tokensConfig: {
        WETH: {
          key: 'WETH',
          symbol: 'WETH',
          nativeChain: 'ethereum',
          icon: Icon.ETH,
          tokenId: {
            chain: 'ethereum',
            address: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2',
          },
          coinGeckoId: 'ethereum',
          color: '#62688F',
          decimals: { Ethereum: 18, default: 8 },
          foreignAssets: {
            Solana: {
              address: '7vfCXTUXx5WJV5JADk17DUJ4ksgau7utNKj4b963voxs',
              decimals: 8,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    };
    ```
=== "v1.x"

    In v1.0, `foreignAssets` has been replaced with `wrappedTokens`, simplifying token transfers across chains by directly mapping wrapped token addresses. The `decimals` value is now a simple number representing the token’s decimals on its native chain.

    ```typescript
    import WormholeConnect, {
      WormholeConnectConfig,
    } from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      tokensConfig: {
        WETH: {
          key: 'WETH',
          symbol: 'WETH',
          nativeChain: 'Ethereum', // Chain name now capitalized
          icon: Icon.ETH,
          tokenId: {
            chain: 'Ethereum',
            address: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2',
          },
          coinGeckoId: 'ethereum',
          color: '#62688F',
          decimals: 18, // Simplified decimals field
        },
      },
      wrappedTokens: {
        WETH: {
          Solana: '7vfCXTUXx5WJV5JADk17DUJ4ksgau7utNKj4b963voxs',
          /* additional chains */
        },
      },
    };
    ```

### Update NTT Configuration

In Wormhole Connect version 1.0, the `nttGroups` property, which was used to configure Native Token Transfers (NTT), has been removed. Instead, the NTT configuration is passed directly to the NTT route constructor. This update simplifies the setup and provides more flexibility for defining NTT routes.

Key changes:

 - **Removed `nttGroups`** - the `nttGroups` property has been removed from the configuration and is now passed as an argument to the `nttRoutes` function
 - **Direct NTT route configuration** - NTT routes are now defined more explicitly, allowing for a more organized structure when specifying tokens, chains, and managers

This change simplifies the configuration process by providing a cleaner, more flexible way to handle NTT routes across different chains.

=== "v0.x"

    In the previous version, `nttGroups` defined the NTT managers and transceivers for different tokens across multiple chains.

    ```typescript
    import WormholeConnect, {
      nttRoutes,
      WormholeConnectConfig,
    } from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      nttGroups: {
        Lido_wstETH: {
          nttManagers: [
            {
              chainName: 'ethereum',
              address: '0xb948a93827d68a82F6513Ad178964Da487fe2BD9',
              tokenKey: 'wstETH',
              transceivers: [
                {
                  address: '0xA1ACC1e6edaB281Febd91E3515093F1DE81F25c0',
                  type: 'wormhole',
                },
              ],
            },
            {
              chainName: 'bsc',
              address: '0x6981F5621691CBfE3DdD524dE71076b79F0A0278',
              tokenKey: 'wstETH',
              transceivers: [
                {
                  address: '0xbe3F7e06872E0dF6CD7FF35B7aa4Bb1446DC9986',
                  type: 'wormhole',
                },
              ],
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    };
    ```
=== "v1.x"

    In v1.0, `nttGroups` has been removed, and the configuration is passed to the NTT route constructor as an argument. The tokens and corresponding transceivers are now clearly defined within the `nttRoutes` configuration.

    ```typescript
    import WormholeConnect, {
      nttRoutes,
      WormholeConnectConfig,
    } from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      routes: [
        ...nttRoutes({
          tokens: {
            Lido_wstETH: [
              {
                chain: 'Ethereum',
                manager: '0xb948a93827d68a82F6513Ad178964Da487fe2BD9',
                token: '0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0',
                transceiver: [
                  {
                    address: '0xA1ACC1e6edaB281Febd91E3515093F1DE81F25c0',
                    type: 'wormhole',
                  },
                ],
              },
              {
                chain: 'Bsc',
                manager: '0x6981F5621691CBfE3DdD524dE71076b79F0A0278',
                token: '0x26c5e01524d2E6280A48F2c50fF6De7e52E9611C',
                transceiver: [
                  {
                    address: '0xbe3F7e06872E0dF6CD7FF35B7aa4Bb1446DC9986',
                    type: 'wormhole',
                  },
                ],
              },
            ],
          },
        }),
        /* other routes */
      ],
    };
    ```

    In this new structure, NTT routes are passed directly through the `nttRoutes` function, with the `token`, `chain`, `manager` and `transceiver` clearly defined for each supported asset.

### Update UI Configuration

In Wormhole Connect version 1.0, the user interface configuration has been significantly updated. Several previously scattered UI properties have now been consolidated under a new `ui` key, making the UI configuration cleaner and easier to manage.

Key UI changes:

 - **Consolidated UI properties** - many UI-related properties moved under a new top-level ui key for better organization
 - **Removed `customTheme` and `mode`** - these properties have been removed in favor of a new top-level prop called `theme`, which simplifies theming and allows dynamic switching between themes

#### UI Properties

The following properties that were previously defined at the root level of the configuration are now part of the `ui` key:

 - `explorer` → `ui.explorer` - specifies the explorer to use for viewing transactions
 - `bridgeDefaults` → `ui.defaultInputs` - sets default input values for the bridge, such as the source and destination chains and token
 - `pageHeader` → `ui.pageHeader` - sets the title and header for the page
 - `menu` → `ui.menu` - defines the menu items displayed in the interface
 - `searchTx` → `ui.searchTx` - configures the transaction search functionality
 - `partnerLogo` → `ui.partnerLogo` - displays a partner's logo on the interface
 - `walletConnectProjectId` → `ui.walletConnectProjectId` - integrates WalletConnect into the UI
 - `showHamburgerMenu` → `ui.showHamburgerMenu` - enables or disables the hamburger menu for navigation

Additionally, there are two new properties under `ui`:

 - **`ui.title`** - sets the title rendered in the top left corner of the UI. The default is "Wormhole Connect"
 - **`ui.getHelpUrl`** - URL that Connect will render when an unknown error occurs, allowing users to seek help. This can link to a Discord server or any other support channel

```typescript
import WormholeConnect, {
  WormholeConnectConfig,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  ui: {
    title: 'My Custom Bridge Example',
    getHelpUrl: 'https://examplehelp.com/',
    menu: [
      {
        label: 'Support',
        href: 'https://examplehelp.com/support',
        target: '_blank',
        order: 1, // Order of appearance in the menu
      },
      {
        label: 'About',
        href: 'https://examplehelp.com/about',
        target: '_blank',
        order: 2,
      },
    ],
    showHamburgerMenu: false,
  },
};
```

#### UI Configuration

In the old structure, UI-related settings like `explorer` and `bridgeDefaults` were defined at the root level of the configuration. In version 1.0, these properties are now organized under the `ui` key, improving the configuration's readability and manageability.

=== "v0.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      bridgeDefaults: {
        fromNetwork: 'solana',
        toNetwork: 'ethereum',
        tokenKey: 'USDC',
        requiredNetwork: 'solana',
      },
      showHamburgerMenu: true,
    };
    ```
=== "v1.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      ui: {
        defaultInputs: {
          fromChain: 'Solana', // Chain names now capitalized
          toChain: 'Ethereum',
          tokenKey: 'USDC',
          requiredChain: 'Solana',
        },
        showHamburgerMenu: true,
      },
    };
    ```

#### Remove `customTheme` and `mode` Properties

In version 1.0, the `customTheme` and `mode` properties, which were previously used to set themes, have been removed. They have been replaced by a new top-level prop called `theme`, which allows for more flexibility and dynamic updates to themes.

Important details:

 - The `theme` prop is not part of the `config` object and is passed separately to Wormhole Connect
 - `config` cannot be modified after Connect has mounted, but the `theme` can be updated dynamically to support changes such as switching between light and dark modes or updating color schemes

=== "v0.x"

    ```typescript
    const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
      customTheme: {
        primaryColor: '#4266f5',
        secondaryColor: '#ff5733',
      },
      mode: 'dark',
    };

    <WormholeConnect config={config} />;
    ```
=== "v1.x"

    ```typescript
    const theme: WormholeConnectTheme = {
      mode: 'dark', // Can be dynamically changed
      font: 'Arial',
      button: {
        primary: '#4266f5',
      },
    };

    <WormholeConnect config={config} theme={theme} />;
    ```

### Removed Configuration Properties

Several configuration properties have been removed in Wormhole Connect version 1.0. These keys no longer have any effect, and providing values for them in the configuration will not result in any changes.

Removed config keys:

 - `cta`
 - `cctpWarning`
 - `pageSubHeader`
 - `moreTokens`
 - `moreChains`
 - `ethBridgeMaxAmount`
 - `wstETHBridgeMaxAmount`
 - `customTheme`
 - `mode`

If your current setup includes any of these properties, you can safely remove them, as they are no longer supported in v1.0.

## Use the CDN-Hosted Version of Wormhole Connect

For those using the CDN-hosted version of Wormhole Connect, the package's installation and integration have been updated. You must install the Connect package from npm and use the new `wormholeConnectHosted` utility function.

### Install and Integrate the Hosted Version

1. Install the Connect package via npm:

    ```bash
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect@^1.0
    ```

2. After installing the package, you can embed Wormhole Connect into your page by adding the following code:

    ```typescript
    import { wormholeConnectHosted } from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

    const container = document.getElementById('connect')!;

    wormholeConnectHosted(container);
    ```

### Example: Custom Configuration for Hosted Version

The `wormholeConnectHosted` function accepts two parameters: `config` and `theme`. This allows you to customize the routes and apply a theme directly within the hosted version. Here’s an example of how you can pass a custom configuration:

```typescript
import {
  wormholeConnectHosted,
  MayanRoute,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const container = document.getElementById('connect')!;

wormholeConnectHosted(container, {
  config: {
    routes: [MayanRoute],
    eventHandler: (e) => {
      console.log('Connect event', e);
    },
  },
  theme: {
    background: {
      default: '#004547',
    },
  },
});
```

In this example, the `config` object defines the routes (in this case, using the Mayan route), while the `theme` object allows customization of the Connect interface (e.g., background color).

title: Native Token Transfers Access Control
description: Learn about the owner and pauser access roles for the NTT manager contract, which can be used to pause and un-pause token transfers.
---

## Owner and Pauser Roles

Pausing the Native Toke Transfer (NTT) Manager Contract will disallow initiating new token transfers. While the contract is paused, in-flight transfers can still be redeemed (subject to rate limits if configured).

NTT can be paused on a particular chain by updating the `paused` parameter on the deployment to `true` via the NTT CLI, then performing `ntt push` to sync the local configuration with the on-chain deployment.

- **Owner** - full control over NTT contracts, can perform administrative functions. Has the ability to un-pause contracts if they have been paused
- **Pauser** - can pause NTT contracts to halt token transfers temporarily. This role is crucial for responding quickly to adverse events without a prolonged governance process. Cannot un-pause contracts

You may verify the current owner, pauser, and paused status of the NTT Manager contract on the `deployment.json` file in your NTT project directory.

        }
    }
}
```

!!! note
    While the `Pauser` can pause contracts, the ability to un-pause contracts is callable only by the `Owner`.

The `Owner` and the `Pauser` addresses can each pause the contract. Since the contract `Owner` address is typically a multisig or a more complex DAO governance contract, and pausing the contract only affects the availability of token transfers, protocols can choose to set the `Pauser` address to be a different address. Creating a separate `Pauser` helps protocols respond quickly to potential risks without going through a drawn-out process.

Consider separating `Owner` and `Pauser` roles for your multichain deployment. `Owner` and `Pauser` roles are defined directly on the `NttManager` contract.

## Introduction

The Native Token Transfer (NTT) framework provides configurable per-chain rate limits for sending and receiving token transfers. Integrators can manage these limits via their own governance processes to quickly adapt to on-chain activity.

If a transfer is rate-limited on the source chain and queueing is enabled via `shouldQueue = true`, the transfer is placed into an outbound queue and can be released after the rate limit expires.

You can configure the following limits on every chain where NTT is deployed directly using the manager:

- **Sending limit** - a single outbound limit for sending tokens from the chain
- **Per-chain receiving limits** - the maximum receiving limit, which can be configured on a per-chain basis. For example, allowing 100 tokens to be received from Ethereum but only 50 tokens to be received from Arbitrum

Rate limits are replenished every second over a fixed duration. While the default duration is 24 hours, the value is configurable at contract creation. Rate-limited transfers on the destination chain are added to an inbound queue with a similar release delay.

## Update Rate Limits

To configure or update the sending and receiving rate limits, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the deployment file** - open the `deployment.json` file in your NTT project directory. This file contains the configuration for your deployed contracts

2. **Modify the limits section** - for each chain, locate the limits field and update the outbound and inbound values as needed

    ```json
    "limits": {
        "outbound": "1000.000000000000000000",
        "inbound": {
            "Ethereum": "100.000000000000000000",
            "Arbitrum": "50.000000000000000000"
        }
    }
    ```

     - **`outbound`** - sets the maximum tokens allowed to leave the chain
     - **`inbound`** - configures per-chain receiving limits for tokens arriving from specific chains

3. **Push the configuration** - use the NTT CLI to synchronize the updated configuration with the blockchain

    ```bash
    ntt push
    ```

4. **Verify the changes** - after pushing, confirm the new rate limits by checking the deployment status

    ```bash
    ntt status
    ```

???- note "`deployment.json` example"

            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Queuing Mechanism

When a transfer exceeds the rate limit, it is held in a queue and can be released after the set rate limit duration has expired. The sending and receiving queuing behavior is as follows:

- **Sending** - if an outbound transfer violates rate limits, users can either revert and try again later or queue their transfer. Users must return after the queue duration has expired to complete sending their transfer
- **Receiving** - if an inbound transfer violates rate limits, it is in a queue. Users or relayers must return after the queue duration has expired to complete receiving their transfer on the destination chain

Queuing is configured dynamically during each transfer by passing the `shouldQueue` parameter to the [`transfer` function](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/5e7ceaef9a5e7eaa13e823a67c611dc684cc0c1d/evm/src/NttManager/NttManager.sol#L171-L182){target=\_blank} in the `NttManager` contract.

## Cancel Flows

If users bridge frequently between a given source chain and destination chain, the capacity could be exhausted quickly. Loss of capacity can leave other users rate-limited, potentially delaying their transfers.  The outbound transfer cancels the inbound rate limit on the source chain to avoid unintentional delays. This allows for refilling the inbound rate limit by an amount equal to the outbound transfer amount and vice-versa, with the inbound transfer canceling the outbound rate limit on the destination chain and refilling the outbound rate limit with an amount.

# Native Token Transfers (NTT) EVM Development

## Deploy Your Token and Ensure Compatibility

If you still need to do so, deploy the token contract to the destination or spoke chains.

### Requirements for Token Deployment

Wormhole’s NTT is an open framework that supports various deployment modes. The NTT CLI currently supports two deployment modes: burn-and-mint and hub-and-spoke. These modes differ in how tokens are managed across chains.

#### Burn-and-Mint Mode

Tokens integrated with `NttManager` in `burning` mode require the following two functions to be present:

- `burn(uint256 amount)`
- `mint(address account, uint256 amount)`

These functions aren't part of the standard ERC-20 interface. The [`INttToken` interface](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/src/interfaces/INttToken.sol){target=\_blank} documents the required functions and convenience methods, errors, and events.

??? code "View the complete `INttToken` Interface`"
    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache 2

    /// @notice Error when the caller is not the minter.

    /// @param newMinter The new minter.
    event NewMinter(address previousMinter, address newMinter);

    // NOTE: the `mint` method is not present in the standard ERC20 interface.
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;

    // NOTE: the `setMinter` method is not present in the standard ERC20 interface.
    function setMinter(address newMinter) external;

    // NOTE: NttTokens in `burn` mode require the `burn` method to be present.
    //       This method is not present in the standard ERC20 interface, but is
    //       found in the `ERC20Burnable` interface.
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;
}
    ```

Later, you set mint authority to the corresponding `NttManager` contract. You can also follow the scripts in the [example NTT token](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-ntt-token){target=\_blank} repository to deploy a token contract.

#### Hub-and-Spoke Mode

A central hub chain (e.g., Ethereum) manages the total token supply in hub-and-spoke mode. Other chains (spokes) mint or burn tokens during cross-chain transfers, ensuring consistency with the locked tokens on the hub chain.

 - **Hub chain** - tokens are locked on the hub chain when transferring to spoke chains
 - **Spoke chains** - tokens are native to the spoke chains and are either minted or burned during cross-chain transfers

!!! note
    The only requirement for using the NTT framework is an ERC20 token, which can be newly deployed or existing. Steps like setting mint authority apply only to spoke chains.

For example, when transferring tokens from Ethereum (hub) to Polygon (spoke), the NTT Manager locks tokens on Ethereum, and the corresponding amount is minted on Polygon. Similarly, transferring tokens back from Polygon to Ethereum burns the tokens on Polygon and unlocks the equivalent tokens on Ethereum.

This process ensures that the total token supply remains consistent across all chains, with the hub chain acting as the source of truth.

For more detailed information, see the [Deployment Models](/docs/learn/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment/){target=\_blank} page.

### Key Differences Between Modes

 - **Burn-and-mint** - tokens must implement custom `mint` and `burn` functions, allowing each chain to manage token issuance independently
 - **Hub-and-spoke** - tokens only need to be ERC20 compliant, with the hub chain acting as the source of truth for supply consistency

## Deploy NTT

Create a new NTT project:

```bash
ntt new my-ntt-deployment
cd my-ntt-deployment
```

Initialize a new `deployment.json` file specifying the network:

=== "Testnet"

    ```bash
    ntt init Testnet
    ```

=== "Mainnet"

    ```bash
    ntt init Mainnet
    ```

Ensure you have set up your environment correctly: 

```bash
export ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Add each chain you'll be deploying to. The following example demonstrates configuring NTT in burn-and-mint mode on Ethereum Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia:

```bash
# Set scanner API Keys as environment variables
export SEPOLIA_SCAN_API_KEY=INSERT_ETHERSCAN_SEPOLIA_API_KEY
export ARBITRUMSEPOLIA_SCAN_API_KEY=INSERT_ARBISCAN_SEPOLIA_API_KEY

# Add each chain
# The contracts will be automatically verified using the scanner API keys above
ntt add-chain Sepolia --latest --mode burning --token INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_ADDRESS
ntt add-chain ArbitrumSepolia --latest --mode burning --token INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_ADDRESS
```

While not recommended, you can pass the `-skip-verify` flag to the `ntt add-chain` command if you want to skip contract verification.

The `ntt add-chain` command takes the following parameters:

- Name of each chain
- Version of NTT to deploy (use `--latest` for the latest contract versions)
- Mode (either `burning` or `locking`)
- Your token contract address

The NTT CLI prints detailed logs and transaction hashes, so you can see exactly what's happening under the hood.

## Configure NTT

The NTT CLI takes inspiration from [git](https://git-scm.com/){target=\_blank}. You can run:

- `ntt status` - checks whether your `deployment.json` file is consistent with what is on-chain
- `ntt pull` - syncs your `deployment.json` file with the on-chain configuration and set up rate limits with the appropriate number of decimals, depending on the specific chain. For example:

    For Solana, the limits are set with 9 decimal places:
      ```json
      "inbound": {
          "Sepolia": "1000.000000000" // inbound limit from Sepolia to Solana
      }
      ```

    For Sepolia (Ethereum Testnet), the limits are set with 18 decimal places:
      ```json
      "inbound": {
          "Solana": "1000.000000000000000000" // inbound limit from Solana to Sepolia
      }
      ```

    This initial configuration ensures that the rate limits are correctly represented for each chain's token precision
  
- `ntt push` - syncs the on-chain configuration with local changes made to your `deployment.json` file

After you deploy the NTT contracts, ensure that the deployment is properly configured and your local representation is consistent with the actual on-chain state by running `ntt status` and following the instructions shown on the screen.

## Set Token Minter to NTT Manager

The final step in the deployment process is to set the NTT Manager as a minter of your token on all chains you have deployed to in `burning` mode. When performing a hub-and-spoke deployment, it is only necessary to set the NTT Manager as a minter of the token on each spoke chain.

!!! note
    The required NTT Manager address can be found in the `deployment.json` file.

- If you followed the [`INttToken`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/src/interfaces/INttToken.sol){target=\_blank} interface, you can execute the `setMinter(address newMinter)` function
    ```json
    cast send $TOKEN_ADDRESS "setMinter(address)" $NTT_MANAGER_ADDRESS --private-key $ETH_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $YOUR_RPC_URL  
    ```

- If you have a custom process to manage token minters, you should now follow that process to add the corresponding NTT Manager as a minter

By default, NTT transfers to EVM blockchains support automatic relaying via the Wormhole relayer, which doesn't require the user to perform a transaction on the destination chain to complete the transfer.

# Deploy Native Token Transfers on Solana

[Native Token Transfers (NTT)](/docs/learn/transfers/native-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank} enable seamless multichain transfers of SPL tokens on Solana using Wormhole's messaging protocol. Instead of creating wrapped tokens, NTT allows native assets to move across chains while maintaining their original properties.

This guide walks you through deploying NTT on Solana, including setting up dependencies, configuring token compatibility, and using the NTT CLI to deploy in hub-and-spoke or burn-and-mint mode.

By the end, a fully deployed NTT will be set up, allowing your token to transfer between Solana and other supported chains.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying NTT on Solana, ensure you have the following:

-  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install){target=\_blank} 
-  [Solana](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install){target=\_blank} **`{{ ntt.solana_cli_version }}`**
-  [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation){target=\_blank} **`{{ ntt.anchor_version }}`**

Use the Solana and Anchor versions listed above to avoid compatibility issues while following this guide.

## Overview of the Deployment Process

Deploying NTT with the CLI on Solana follows a structured process:

1. **Choose your token setup**:

     - **Use an existing SPL token** - if your token is already deployed on Solana, you can skip token creation and move directly to the [Set Up NTT](#set-up-ntt) section
     - **Create a new SPL token** - if you don't already have an SPL token deployed, you'll need to deploy and configure it on Solana before integrating with Wormhole's NTT

2. **Choose your [deployment model](/docs/learn/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment/){target=\_blank}**:

     - **Hub-and-spoke** - tokens are locked on a hub chain and minted on destination spoke chains. Since the token supply remains controlled by the hub chain, no changes to the minting authority are required
     - **Burn-and-mint** - tokens are burned on the source chain and minted on the destination chain. This requires transferring the SPL token's minting authority to the Program Derived Address (PDA) controlled by the NTT program

3. **Deploy and configure NTT** - use the NTT CLI to initialize and deploy the NTT program, specifying your SPL token and deployment mode


Following this process, your token will fully integrate with NTT, enabling seamless transfers between Solana and other chains.

By default, NTT transfers to Solana require manual [relaying](/docs/learn/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank}, meaning users must complete a transaction on Solana to finalize the transfer. For automatic relaying, where transactions are completed without user intervention, additional setup is required. [Contact Wormhole contributors](https://forms.clickup.com/45049775/f/1aytxf-10244/JKYWRUQ70AUI99F32Q){target=\_blank} to enable automatic relaying support for your deployment.

## Create and Mint Tokens

This section walks you through generating a Solana wallet, deploying an SPL token, creating a token account, and minting tokens.

If you already have an SPL token, skip to [Set Up NTT](#set-up-ntt).

1. **Generate a Solana key pair** - run the following command to create a new wallet:

    ```bash
    solana-keygen grind --starts-with w:1 --ignore-case
    ```

2. **Set Solana configuration** - configure the Solana CLI to use the generated key pair using the following command:

    ```bash
    solana config set --keypair INSERT_PATH_TO_KEYPAIR_JSON
    ```

3. **Select an RPC URL** - configure Solana to use the appropriate network using one of the following commands:

    === "Mainnet"
        ```bash
        solana config set -um
        ```

    === "Testnet"
        ```bash
        solana config set -ut
        ```

    === "Devnet"
        ```bash
        solana config set -ud
        ```

4. **Fund your wallet** - ensure you have enough SOL to create a token. If deploying on devnet, request an airdrop with the following commands:

    ```bash
    solana airdrop 2
    solana balance
    ```

5. **Install SPL Token CLI** - install or update the required [CLI tool](https://spl.solana.com/token){target=\_blank}

    ```bash
    cargo install spl-token-cli
    ```

6. **Create a new SPL token** - initialize the token on Solana

    ```bash
    spl-token create-token
    ```

7. **Create a token account** - generate an account to hold the token

    ```bash
    spl-token create-account INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS
    ```

8. **Mint tokens** - send 1000 tokens to the created account

    ```bash
    spl-token mint INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS 1000
    ```

NTT versions `>=v2.0.0+solana` support SPL tokens with [transfer hooks](https://spl.solana.com/transfer-hook-interface){target=\_blank}.

## Set Up NTT

To integrate your token with NTT on Solana, you must initialize the deployment and configure its parameters. This process sets up the required contracts and may generate key pairs if they don't exist. These key pairs are used to sign transactions and authorize actions within the NTT deployment.

The [NTT CLI](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/installation/){target=\_blank} manages deployments, configures settings, and interacts with the NTT system. Follow these steps to set up NTT using the CLI tool:

1. **Create a new NTT project** - set up a deployment workspace

    ```bash
    ntt new INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    ```

2. **Initialize the deployment** - generate a `deployment.json` file with your deployment settings

    === "Mainnet"

        ```bash
        ntt init Mainnet
        ```

    === "Testnet"

        ```bash
        ntt init Testnet
        ```
    
    === "Devnet"

        ```bash
        ntt init Devnet
        ```

### Set Mint Authority

If you use burn-and-mint mode, follow these steps to enable the NTT program to mint tokens on Solana. This involves deriving the PDA as the token authority and updating the SPL token's minting permissions.

If you want to use hub-and-spoke, skip this section and proceed to [Deploy and Configure NTT](#deploy-and-configure-ntt).

Before updating the mint authority, you must create metadata for your SPL token. You can visit this repository to see an example of [how to create metadata for your SPL token](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-metaplex-metadata/blob/main/src/token-metadata.ts){target=\_blank}.

Follow these steps to set the mint authority using the NTT CLI:

1. **Generate an NTT program key pair** - create a unique key pair for the NTT program. The key pair must start with "ntt" to identify it as belonging to the NTT deployment

    ```bash
    solana-keygen grind --starts-with ntt:1 --ignore-case
    ```

2. **Derive the token authority** - generate the PDA, which will manage token minting

    ```bash
    ntt solana token-authority INSERT_YOUR_NTT_PROGRAM_KEY_PAIR
    ```

3. **Set SPL token mint authority** - delegate minting control to the derived PDA 

    ```bash
    spl-token authorize INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS mint INSERT_DERIVED_PDA
    ```

## Deploy and Configure NTT

After setting up your deployment, finalize the configuration and deploy the NTT program on Solana by following these steps:

1. **Deploy NTT to Solana** - run the appropriate command based on your deployment mode:

    === "Burn-and-Mint"

        ```bash
        ntt add-chain Solana --latest --mode burning --token INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS --payer INSERT_YOUR_KEYPAIR_JSON --program-key INSERT_YOUR_NTT_PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_JSON
        ```

    === "Hub-and-Spoke"

        ```bash
        ntt add-chain Solana --latest --mode locking --token INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS --payer INSERT_YOUR_KEYPAIR_JSON --program-key INSERT_YOUR_NTT_PROGRAM_KEYPAIR_JSON
        ```

    !!! tip
        The `add-chain` command accepts an optional `--solana-priority-fee` flag, which sets the priority fee in microlamports. The default is `50000`.

2. **Verify deployment status** - after deployment, check if your `deployment.json` file matches the on-chain configuration using the following command:

    ```bash
    ntt status
    ```

    If needed, sync your local configuration with the on-chain state:

    ```bash
    ntt pull
    ```

3. **Configure inbound and outbound rate limits** - by default, the inbound and outbound limits are set to `0` and must be updated before deployment. For EVM chains, values must be set using 18 decimals, while Solana uses nine decimals. 

    Open your `deployment.json` file and adjust the values based on your use case:  

    ```json
    "inbound": {
        "Sepolia": "1000.000000000" // inbound limit from Sepolia to Solana
    },
    "outbound": {
        "Sepolia": "1000.000000000" // outbound limit from Solana to Sepolia
    }
    ```

4. **Push the final deployment** - once rate limits are set, push the deployment to Solana using the specified key pair to cover gas fees

    ```bash
    ntt push --payer INSERT_YOUR_KEYPAIR_JSON
    ```

### Troubleshoot Deployment Issues
    
If your deployment fails, it may be due to leftover program buffer accounts taking up storage on Solana. These temporary accounts are created during deployment but may persist if interrupted. Refer to the [Solana program deployment guide](https://solana.com/docs/programs/deploying#program-buffer-accounts){target=\_blank} for instructions on finding and closing these buffer accounts to free up space and allow redeployment.

# Deploy Native Token Transfers with Launchpad

## Introduction

The [Native Token Transfers (NTT) Launchpad](https://ntt.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank} is a Wormhole-managed UI application that provides a step-by-step interface for deploying NTT across multiple blockchains.

Instead of manually deploying contracts on each chain, configuring relayers, and managing cross-chain communication, you can quickly launch or expand tokens with just a few clicks. 

The Launchpad automates deployment, reducing complexity and saving time.

This guide covers:

 - Launching a new cross-chain token
 - Expanding an existing token for NTT
 - Managing tokens via the dashboard and settings

## Prerequisites

 - An EVM-compatible wallet (e.g., [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank}, [Phantom](https://phantom.com/){target=\_blank}, etc.)
 - Minimum ETH (or equivalent) for gas fees per deployment

## Supported Blockchains

The NTT Launchpad currently supports deployments on the following mainnet chains:

 - Ethereum
 - Optimism Mainnet
 - Arbitrum One
 - Base

## Choose Your Path

Once ready, choose an option to proceed:

 - [**Launch a Cross-Chain Token**](#launch-a-cross-chain-token) - deploy a brand-new token that is NTT-ready from day one, enabling seamless transfers across multiple blockchains
 - [**Expand Your Existing Token**](#expand-your-existing-token) - if you already have a token deployed on different chains, integrate it with NTT to enable NTT without modifying its original contract

## Launch a Cross-Chain Token

Deploy a new NTT-compatible token that can be transferred across multiple chains. This process sets up your token on a home network and deploys it to additional blockchains. Follow the below steps to get started:

1. Open the [NTT Launchpad](https://ntt.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank}, connect your wallet, and click **Get Started**

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-1.webp)
    
2. Select **Launch a Cross-Chain Token**

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-2.webp)

3. Set the token details:
    1. Select the **home network** from the dropdown menu
    2. Enter the **name** for the token
    3. Enter the **symbol** of the token 
    4. Provide the **initial supply**
    5. To the token details, click **Next**

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-3.webp)

4. Select the deployment chains:
    1. The home network where your token will be deployed will be populated (e.g., Optimism)
    2. Choose any additional chains to deploy your token to (e.g., Base)
    3. To continue, click **Next**

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-4.webp)

5. To deploy on the first chain (Optimism), click on **Deploy**; if prompted, switch your wallet to the correct network and confirm the transaction

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-5.webp)

6. Once deployed, you can view the transaction in a block explorer and add the token to your wallet

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-6.webp)

7. Repeat the previous step to deploy the token on the second chain (Base). The supply of tokens on Base will be zero since the tokens were all minted on Optimism in the previous step

8. Once both deployments are completed, proceed to the [**Dashboard**](#explore-the-launchpad-dashboard) to manage your token.

## Expand Your Existing Token

Expand an existing token to support NTT across multiple chains. This process integrates your deployed token with NTT without modifying its original contract. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Open the [NTT Launchpad](https://ntt.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank}, connect your wallet, and click **Get Started**

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-1.webp)

2. Select **Expand Your Existing Token**

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-7.webp)

3. Enter the token details:
    1. Choose the home network where your token is already deployed (e.g., Optimism)
    2. Choose any additional chains to deploy your token to (e.g., Base)
    3. To continue, click **Next**

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-8.webp)

4. Select the chains to deploy your token to:
    1. The home network where your token is already deployed will be populated (e.g., Optimism)
    2. Choose any additional chains to deploy your token to (e.g., Base)
    1. Click **Next**

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-9.webp)

5. To deploy on the first chain (Optimism), click on **Deploy**; if prompted, switch your wallet to the correct network and confirm the transaction

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-5.webp)

6. Once deployed, you can view the transaction in a block explorer and add the token to your wallet

    ![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-6.webp)

7. Repeat the previous step to deploy the token on the second chain (Base). The supply of tokens on Base will be zero since the tokens were all minted on Optimism in the previous step

8. Now that your token has been deployed on multiple chains click [**Dashboard**](#explore-the-launchpad-dashboard) to review its details

## Explore the Launchpad Dashboard

To access the **Dashboard** from the [Launchpad home page](https://ntt.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank}, click on **Manage Deployment**. Here, you can view deployment status, monitor supply across chains, and configure transfer settings.

![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-10.webp)

The dashboard provides a high-level view of your token across all deployed chains, including:

 - Token addresses for each chain
 - Supply distribution visualization
 - List of deployed chains, including inbound and outbound transfer limits, which can be modified in [**Settings**](#settings)

![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-11.webp)

## Settings

The **Settings** page allows you to configure security parameters, role management, and transfer limits for your deployed token. You can switch between chains to manage these settings independently for each deployment.

### Chain Management

Use the drop-down menu at the top to select the chain you want to configure. The available options correspond to the chains where your token has already been deployed. Once selected, the page displays token details specific to that chain.

From this section, you can also:

 - **Pause the token** – temporarily turn off transfers on the selected chain
 - **Deploy to a new chain** – expand your token by deploying it to an additional chain

![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-12.webp)

### Role Management

This section displays key [roles](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/configuration/access-control/){target=\_blank} involved in token governance. You can view and modify these roles by selecting a new address and confirming the update.

 - **Manager’s Owner** – the owner through the `NTTOwner` proxy
 - **Pauser** – the address authorized to pause transfers

![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-13.webp)

### Security Threshold

Determine and update how transceivers interact with the token. [Transceivers](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/managers-transceivers/#transceivers){target=\_blank} route NTT transfers between blockchains, ensuring tokens are correctly sent and received across networks.

A higher transceiver threshold increases security by requiring more approvals before processing a transfer, but it may also slow down transactions. A lower threshold allows faster transfers but reduces redundancy in message verification.  

 - **Registered Transceivers** – displays the number of registered transceivers and their addresses
 - **Transceivers Threshold** – a configurable value that must be less than or equal to the number of transceivers

![](/docs/images/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/evm-launchpad/ntt-launchpad-14.webp)

### Peer Chains Limits

Define the transfer restrictions for each connected network. You can adjust:

 - **Sending Limits** – the maximum amount of tokens that can be sent from the home chain
 - **Receiving Limits** – the maximum amount of tokens that can be received for each of the supported peer chains

Enter a new value to adjust limits and click **Update**. The changes will take effect immediately.

## Install NTT CLI

The fastest way to deploy Native Token Transfers (NTT) is using the NTT CLI. As prerequisites, ensure you have the following installed:

- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/){target=\_blank}

Follow these steps to install the NTT CLI:

1. Run the installation command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/main/cli/install.sh | bash
    ```

2. Verify the NTT CLI is installed:

    ```bash
    ntt --version
    ```

3. Once installed, check out the available [NTT CLI Commands](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/cli-commands/){target=\_blank} to start using the CLI

## Update NTT CLI

To update an existing NTT CLI installation, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ntt update
```

NTT CLI installations and updates will always pick up the latest tag with name vX.Y.Z+cli and verify that the underlying commit is included in main.

For local development, you can update your CLI version from a specific branch or install from a local path.

To install from a specific branch, run:

```bash
ntt update --branch foo
```

To install locally, run:
```bash
ntt update --path path/to/ntt/repo
```

Git branch and local installations enable a fast iteration loop as changes to the CLI code will immediately be reflected in the running binary without having to run any build steps.

# Native Token Transfers Post Deployment

To offer the best user experience and ensure the most robust deployment, Wormhole contributors recommend the following after you have deployed Native Token Transfers (NTT):

- Implement a robust testing plan for your multichain token before launching
- Ensure comprehensive, documented security measures are followed for custody of contract ownership, control of keys, and access control roles. Check the [NTT configuration](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/configuration/){target=\_blank} for more details on ownership and rate limits
- Consider a streamlined, customizable frontend such as [Wormhole Connect](/docs/build/transfers/connect/){target=\_blank} for an optimized user experience
- Alternatively, the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/){target=\_blank} allows for a direct integration into your infrastructure
- Ensure ecosystem actors such as block explorers, automated security tools (such as BlockAid and Blowfish), and wallets (such as MetaMask, Backpack, and Phantom) are aware of your multichain deployment and that it is labeled appropriately
- Monitor and maintain your multichain deployment

## Manual Relaying for Solana Transfers  

By default, NTT transfers to Solana require manual relaying, meaning that after initiating a cross-chain transfer, the recipient must submit an on-chain transaction to claim the tokens.

This step ensures that tokens are properly minted or unlocked on Solana and prevents unauthorized claims.

[Wormhole Connect](/docs/build/applications/connect/){target=\_blank} support this process automatically.

# Troubleshooting NTT Deployment

If you encounter issues during the NTT deployment process, check the following common points:

- **Solana and Anchor versions** - ensure you are using the expected versions of Solana and Anchor as outlined in the [deployment page](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/deploy-to-solana/#install-dependencies){target=\_blank}
    -  [Solana](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install){target=\_blank} **`{{ ntt.solana_cli_version }}`**
    -  [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation){target=\_blank} **`{{ ntt.anchor_version }}`**
- **Token compliance on EVM** - verify that your token is an ERC20 token on the EVM chain
- **Mint authority transfer**
    - **For burn or spoke tokens on Solana** - ensure the token mint authority was transferred as described in the [set SPL Token Mint Authority](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/deploy-to-solana/#set-spl-token-mint-authority){target=\_blank} section
    - **For EVM tokens** - confirm the token minter was set to the NTT Manager. Refer to the [set Token Minter to NTT Manager](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/deploy-to-evm/#set-token-minter-to-ntt-manager){target=\_blank} section for details
- **Decimal configuration** - run `ntt pull` to correctly configure the decimals in your `deployment.json` file. More details in the [configure NTT](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/deploy-to-solana/#configure-ntt){target=\_blank} section
- **Rate limit configuration** - increase your rate limits to a value greater than zero. A rate limit of zero can cause transactions to get stuck. Learn more on how to [configure rate limits](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/deployment-process/deploy-to-evm/#configure-ntt){target=\_blank}
- **Docker environment based on Ubuntu 20.04 with all dependencies required for Wormhole NTT CLI development** - run `docker compose up -d` to start the container in your terminal from the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file

# Wormhole NTT FAQs

## Do you have an example of how cross-chain lending can be implemented using Wormhole?

Yes, we have an example of cross-chain lending that leverages [Wormhole’s Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/){target=\_blank}. In this example, collateral deposits (such as ETH on Ethereum) are bridged to a hub chain. Once the collateral is deposited, the borrowed assets, like wrapped BNB, are bridged to Binance Smart Chain. You can explore the full implementation in the [Wormhole Lending Examples repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-wormhole-lending){target=_blank} on GitHub.

Alternatively, you can also implement cross-chain lending using [Wormhole’s core messaging](/docs/learn/transfers/native-token-transfers/){target=\_blank} instead of the Token Bridge, which avoids the limitations imposed by governor limits. ETH would be custodied on Ethereum, and BNB on the Binance spoke during this setup. When a user deposits ETH on Ethereum, a core bridge message is sent to the hub for accounting purposes. The hub then emits a message that can be redeemed on Binance to release the BNB. This approach allows for more direct asset control across chains while reducing reliance on Token Bridge limits.

## What causes the "No protocols registered for Evm" error in Wormhole SDK?

This error typically occurs when the [Wormhole SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank} cannot recognize or register the necessary EVM protocols, which are required for interacting with Ethereum-based networks. The most common reason for this error is that the relevant EVM package for Wormhole's NTT has not been imported correctly.

To resolve this issue, ensure you have imported the appropriate Wormhole SDK package for EVM environments. The necessary package for handling NTT on EVM chains is `@wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm-ntt`. Here's the correct import statement:

```rust
import '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm-ntt';
```

By importing this package, the Wormhole SDK can register and utilize the required protocols for EVM chains, enabling cross-chain token transfers using the NTT framework. Ensure to include this import at the start of your code, especially before attempting any interactions with EVM chains in your project.

## How can I transfer ownership of NTT to a multisig?

Transferring ownership of Wormhole's NTT to a multisig is a two-step process for safety. This ensures that ownership is not transferred to an address that cannot claim it. Refer to the `transfer_ownership` method in the [NTT Manager Contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/solana/programs/example-native-token-transfers/src/instructions/admin/transfer_ownership.rs#L55){target=\_blank} to initiate the transfer.

1. **Initiate transfer** - use the `transfer_ownership` method on the NTT Manager contract to set the new owner (the multisig)
2. **Claim ownership** - the multisig must then claim ownership via the `claim_ownership` instruction. If not claimed, the current owner can cancel the transfer
3. **Single-step transfer (Riskier)** - you can also use the `transfer_ownership_one_step_unchecked` method to transfer ownership in a single step, but if the new owner cannot sign, the contract may become locked. Be cautious and ensure the new owner is a Program Derived Address (PDA)

For a practical demonstration of transferring ownership of Wormhole's NTT to a multisig on Solana, visit the [GitHub demo](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-ntt-solana-multisig-tools){target=\_blank} providing scripts and guidance for managing an NTT program using Squads multisig functionality, including ownership transfer procedures.

## How can I specify a custom RPC for NTT?

To specify a custom RPC for Wormhole's NTT, create an `overrides.json` file in the root of your deployment directory. This file allows you to define custom RPC endpoints, which can be helpful when you need to connect to specific nodes or networks for better performance, security, or control over the RPC connection.

Below’s an example of how the `overrides.json` file should be structured:

???- code "`overrides.json`"
    ```json
    {
    "chains": {
        "Bsc": {
            "rpc": "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
        },
        "Sepolia": {
            "rpc": "http://127.0.0.1:8546"
        },
        "Solana": {
            "rpc": "http://127.0.0.1:8899"
        }
        }
    }
    ```

## How can I redeem tokens if NTT rate limits block them on the target chain?

If the rate limits on Wormhole's NTT block tokens from being received on the target chain, the transaction will typically be paused until the rate limits are adjusted. Rate limits are implemented to manage congestion and prevent chain abuse, but they can occasionally delay token redemptions.

To resolve this:

1. **Adjust rate limits** - the rate limits must be modified by an administrator or through the appropriate configuration tools to allow the blocked transaction to proceed
2. **Resume transaction flow** - once the rate limits are adjusted, you can resume the flow, which should be visible in the UI. The tokens will then be redeemable on the target chain

In most cases, the transaction will resume automatically once the rate limits are adjusted, and the UI will guide you through the redemption process.

## What are the challenges of deploying NTT to non-EVM chains?

NTT requires the same transceiver for all routes, limiting flexibility when deploying across EVM and non-EVM chains. For example, if you're deploying to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Solana, you can't use Wormhole and Axelar as transceivers because Axelar doesn't support Solana. This constraint forces integrators to use a single transceiver (e.g., Wormhole) for all chains, reducing flexibility in optimizing cross-chain transfers.

## Does the NTT manager function as an escrow account for a hub chain?

Yes, the NTT manager acts like an escrow account for non-transferable tokens on a hub chain. To manage non-transferable tokens, you would add the NTT manager to the allowlist, ensuring that only the NTT manager can hold and control the tokens as they are transferred across chains.

## Which functions or events does Connect rely on for NTT integration?

Connect relies on the NTT SDK for integration, with platform-specific implementations for both [Solana](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/solana/ts/sdk/ntt.ts){target=\_blank} and [EVM](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/ts/src/ntt.ts){target=\_blank}. The key methods involved include:

- **Initiate and redeem functions** - these functions are essential for initiating token transfers and redeeming them on the destination chain
- **Rate capacity methods** - methods for fetching inbound and outbound rate limits are also critical for controlling the flow of tokens and preventing congestion

These functions ensure Connect can handle token transfers and manage chain-rate limits.

## How does the relayer contract determine which transceiver to call?

The source chain's transceiver includes the destination chain's transceiver in the message via the relayer contract. The admin configures each transceiver's mapping of its peers on other chains. This mapping allows the destination transceiver to verify that the message came from a trusted source.

## How do I create a verifier or transceiver?

To run your verifier, you need to implement a transceiver. This involves approximately 200 lines of code, leveraging the base functionality provided by the [abstract transceiver contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/src/Transceiver/Transceiver.sol){target=\_blank}.

For reference, you can review the [Axelar transceiver implementation](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-wormhole-axelar-wsteth/blob/main/src/axelar/AxelarTransceiver.sol){target=\_blank}.

## Can I use Hetzner for the NTT deployment?

No, using Hetzner servers for Solana deployments is not recommended. Hetzner has blocked Solana network activity on its servers, leading to connection issues. Hetzner nodes will return a `ConnectionRefused: Unable to connect` error for Solana deployments. Therefore, choosing alternative hosting providers that support Solana deployments is advisable to ensure seamless operation.

## How can I transfer tokens with NTT with an additional payload?

You can include an extra payload in NTT messages by overriding specific methods in the [NttManager contract](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/src/NttManager/NttManager.sol){target=\_blank}.

- On the source chain, override the [`_handleMsg` function](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/src/NttManager/NttManager.sol#L216-L226){target=\_blank} to query any additional data you need for the transfer. The extra payload can then be added to the message
- On the destination chain override the [`_handleAdditionalPayload` function](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/blob/main/evm/src/NttManager/NttManager.sol#L262-L275){target=\_blank} to process and utilize the extra payload sent in the message

!!!Important
    You cannot pass the additional data as part of the entry point directly. Instead, the data must be queried on-chain via the `_handleMsg` method, ensuring the payload is properly included and processed.

## Why use NTT over xERC20?

Shortcomings of xERC20:

- **Single point of failure** - xERC20 relies on multiple bridges, but a compromise in any single bridge can jeopardize the token. It enforces a 1-of-n design rather than a more robust m-of-n approach
- **No pausing** - xERC20 lacks mechanisms to pause operations during emergencies
- **No access control** - there are no built-in access controls for managing token transfers securely
- **Limited rate limiting** - rate limits are bridge-specific and cannot be set per chain, reducing flexibility and security
- **No integration with relaying systems** - xERC20 does not natively support relayer systems, limiting its usability in automated or dynamic setups

While xERC20 is an extension of the ERC20 standard, NTT is designed as a framework rather than a rigid standard. It is compatible with any token that supports `burn` and `mint` functions and allows the NTT manager to act as a minter. 

## How can I start transferring tokens to a chain that is in burning mode, if no tokens are locked yet?

To begin transferring tokens to a chain in burning mode when no tokens are locked, you must first send tokens to the NTT manager to back the supply. The address of the NTT manager can be found in the `deployment.json` file.

## Is there a way to use NTT tokens with chains that don't currently support NTT?

Yes. NTT tokens can be used with chains that do not support NTT by leveraging the [Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/){target=\_blank}. For example:

- **Wrapped token scenario** - a token, such as the W token, can be bridged to non-NTT networks using the Token Bridge. When the token is bridged to a chain like Sui, a wrapped version of the token is created (e.g., Wrapped W token)
- **Unwrapping requirement** - tokens bridged using the Token Bridge cannot be directly transferred to NTT-supported chains. To transfer them, they must first be unwrapped on the non-NTT chain and then transferred via the appropriate mechanism
- **Messaging consistency** - the Token Bridge exclusively uses Wormhole messaging, ensuring consistent communication across all chains, whether or not they support NTT

This approach ensures interoperability while maintaining the integrity of the token's cross-chain movement.

# Managers and Transceivers

## Managers

_Managers_ oversee the token transfer process and handle rate-limiting and message attestation. They manage interactions with multiple transceivers and ensure that tokens are locked or burned on the source chain before being minted or unlocked on the destination chain. Each NTT manager corresponds to a single token but can control multiple transceivers. Key functions include:

- **`transfer`** - initiate the transfer process where tokens on the source chain are locked or burned. This process ensures that an equivalent amount of tokens can be minted or unlocked on the destination chain

    ```solidity
    function transfer(
        uint256 amount, // amount (in atomic units)
        uint16 recipientChain, // chain ID (Wormhole formatted) 
        bytes32 recipient // recipient address (Wormhole formatted)
    ) external payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint64)
    ```

- **`quoteDeliveryPrice`** - calculate the cost of sending messages across chains by querying the transceivers for estimates on message delivery fees, allowing users to know the price before initiating a transfer

    ```solidity
    function quoteDeliveryPrice(
        uint16 recipientChain, // chain ID (Wormhole formatted) 
        bytes memory transceiverInstructions // extra instructions for transceivers (Transceiver-dependent on whether extra instructions are used/accepted)
    ) public view returns (uint256[] memory, uint256)
    ```

- **`setPeer`** - to maintain secure cross-chain communication, managers establish trust relationships between different instances of NTT manager contracts across chains. By recognizing each other as peers, they ensure that the token transfers happen securely and that rate limits on inbound transactions are respected

    ```solidity
    function setPeer(
        uint16 peerChainId, // chain ID (Wormhole formatted) 
        bytes32 peerContract, // peer NTT Manager address (Wormhole formatted)
        uint8 decimals, // token decimals on the peer chain
        uint256 inboundLimit // inbound rate limit (in atomic units)
    ) public onlyOwner
    ```

## Transceivers

_Transceivers_ are responsible for routing NTT transfers through the manager on the source chain and ensuring they are delivered to the corresponding manager on the recipient chain. They work with managers to ensure that messages are accurately processed and tokens are correctly transferred, providing a reliable system for cross-chain token transfers. Transceivers can be defined independently of the Wormhole core and modified to support any verification backend. Key functions:

- **`sendMessage`** - this external function sends token transfer messages to a specified recipient chain. It encodes the token transfer details into a message format recognized by the system

    ```solidity
    function sendMessage(
        uint16 recipientChain,   // chain ID (Wormhole formatted)
        TransceiverStructs.TransceiverInstruction memory instruction, // extra instruction for the Transceiver (optional, dependent on whether extra instructions are used/accepted for this Transceiver)
        bytes memory nttManagerMessage, // serialized NTT Manager message, provided by the NTT Manager
        bytes32 recipientNttManagerAddress, // NTT Manager address on the recipient chain (Wormhole formatted)
        bytes32 refundAddress // address to receive refunds on the destination chain in case of excess quotes (Wormhole formatted)
    ) external payable nonReentrant onlyNttManager
    ```

- **`quoteDeliveryPrice`** - provides an estimation of the cost associated with delivering a message to a target chain and gauges transaction fees

    ```solidity
    function quoteDeliveryPrice(
        uint16 targetChain,  // chain ID (Wormhole formatted) 
        TransceiverStructs.TransceiverInstruction memory instruction // extra instruction for the Transceiver (optional, dependent on whether extra instructions are used/accepted for this Transceiver)
    ) external view returns (uint256) 
    ```

## Lifecycle of a Message

### EVM

#### Transfer

A client calls on `transfer` to initiate an NTT transfer. The client must specify, at minimum, the transfer amount, the recipient chain, and the recipient address on the recipient chain. `transfer` also supports a flag to specify whether the `NttManager` should queue rate-limited transfers or revert. Clients can also include additional instructions to forward along to the transceiver on the source chain. Depending on the mode set in the initial configuration of the `NttManager` contract, transfers are either "locked" or "burned." Once the transfer has been forwarded to the transceiver, the `NttManager` emits the `TransferSent` event.

**Events**

```ts
/// @notice Emitted when a message is sent from the nttManager.
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0x9716fe52fe4e02cf924ae28f19f5748ef59877c6496041b986fbad3dae6a8ecf
/// @param recipient The recipient of the message.
/// @param amount The amount transferred.
/// @param fee The amount of ether sent along with the tx to cover the delivery fee.
/// @param recipientChain The chain ID of the recipient.
/// @param msgSequence The unique sequence ID of the message.
event TransferSent(
    bytes32 recipient, uint256 amount, uint256 fee, uint16 recipientChain, uint64 msgSequence
);
```

#### Rate Limit

A transfer can be rate-limited on both the source and destination chains. If a transfer is rate-limited on the source chain and the `shouldQueue` flag is enabled, it is added to an outbound queue. The transfer can be released after the configured `_rateLimitDuration` has expired via the `completeOutboundQueuedTransfer` method. The `OutboundTransferQueued` and `OutboundTransferRateLimited` events are emitted.

If the client attempts to release the transfer from the queue before the expiry of the `rateLimitDuration`, the contract reverts with an `OutboundQueuedTransferStillQueued` error.

Similarly, rate-limited transfers on the destination chain are added to an inbound queue. These transfers can be released from the queue via the `completeInboundQueuedTransfer` method, and the `InboundTransferQueued` event is emitted.

If the client attempts to release the transfer from the queue before the `rateLimitDuration` expires, the contract reverts with an `InboundQueuedTransferStillQueued` error.

To deactivate the rate limiter, set `_rateLimitDuration` to 0 and enable the `_skipRateLimiting` field in the `NttManager` constructor. Configuring this incorrectly will throw an error. If the rate limiter is deactivated, the inbound and outbound rate limits can be set to 0.

**Events**

```ts
/// @notice Emitted whenn an outbound transfer is queued.
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0x69add1952a6a6b9cb86f04d05f0cb605cbb469a50ae916139d34495a9991481f.
/// @param queueSequence The location of the transfer in the queue.
event OutboundTransferQueued(uint64 queueSequence);
```

```ts
/// @notice Emitted when an outbound transfer is rate limited.
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0x754d657d1363ee47d967b415652b739bfe96d5729ccf2f26625dcdbc147db68b.
/// @param sender The initial sender of the transfer.
/// @param amount The amount to be transferred.
/// @param currentCapacity The capacity left for transfers within the 24-hour window.
event OutboundTransferRateLimited(
    address indexed sender, uint64 sequence, uint256 amount, uint256 currentCapacity
);
```

```ts
/// @notice Emitted when an inbound transfer is queued
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0x7f63c9251d82a933210c2b6d0b0f116252c3c116788120e64e8e8215df6f3162.
/// @param digest The digest of the message.
event InboundTransferQueued(bytes32 digest);
```

#### Send

Once the `NttManager` forwards the message to the transceiver, the message is transmitted via the `sendMessage method`. The method signature is enforced by the transceiver but transceivers are free to determine their own implementation for transmitting messages. (e.g. a message routed through the Wormhole transceiver can be sent via Wormhole relaying, a custom relayer, or manually published via the core bridge).

Once the message has been transmitted, the contract emits the `SendTransceiverMessage` event.

**Events**

```ts
/// @notice Emitted when a message is sent from the transceiver.
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0x53b3e029c5ead7bffc739118953883859d30b1aaa086e0dca4d0a1c99cd9c3f5.
/// @param recipientChain The chain ID of the recipient.
/// @param message The message.
event SendTransceiverMessage(
    uint16 recipientChain, TransceiverStructs.TransceiverMessage message
);
```

#### Receive

Once a message has been emitted by a transceiver on the source chain, an off-chain process (for example, a relayer) will forward the message to the corresponding transceiver on the recipient chain. The relayer interacts with the transceiver via an entry point to receive messages. For example, the relayer will call the `receiveWormholeMessage` method on the `WormholeTransceiver` contract to execute the message. The `ReceiveRelayedMessage` event is emitted during this process.

This method should also forward the message to the `NttManager` on the destination chain. Note that the transceiver interface doesn't declare a signature for this method because receiving messages is specific to each transceiver, and a one-size-fits-all solution would be overly restrictive.

The `NttManager` contract allows an M of N threshold for transceiver attestations to determine whether a message can be safely executed. For example, if the threshold requirement is 1, the message will be executed after a single transceiver delivers a valid attestation. If the threshold requirement is 2, the message will only be executed after two transceivers deliver valid attestations. When a transceiver attests to a message, the contract emits the `MessageAttestedTo` event.

NTT implements replay protection, so if a given transceiver attempts to deliver a message attestation twice, the contract reverts with `TransceiverAlreadyAttestedToMessage` error. NTT also implements replay protection against re-executing messages. This check also acts as reentrancy protection as well.

If a message has already been executed, the contract ends execution early and emits the `MessageAlreadyExecuted` event instead of reverting via an error. This mitigates the possibility of race conditions from transceivers attempting to deliver the same message when the threshold is less than the total number of available of transceivers (i.e. threshold < totalTransceivers) and notifies the client (off-chain process) so they don't attempt redundant message delivery.

**Events**

```ts
/// @notice Emitted when a relayed message is received.
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0xf557dbbb087662f52c815f6c7ee350628a37a51eae9608ff840d996b65f87475
/// @param digest The digest of the message.
/// @param emitterChainId The chain ID of the emitter.
/// @param emitterAddress The address of the emitter.
event ReceivedRelayedMessage(bytes32 digest, uint16 emitterChainId, bytes32 emitterAddress);
```

```ts
/// @notice Emitted when a message is received.
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0xf6fc529540981400dc64edf649eb5e2e0eb5812a27f8c81bac2c1d317e71a5f0.
/// @param digest The digest of the message.
/// @param emitterChainId The chain ID of the emitter.
/// @param emitterAddress The address of the emitter.
/// @param sequence The sequence of the message.
event ReceivedMessage(
    bytes32 digest, uint16 emitterChainId, bytes32 emitterAddress, uint64 sequence
);
```

```ts
/// @notice Emitted when a message has already been executed to notify client of against retries.
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0x4069dff8c9df7e38d2867c0910bd96fd61787695e5380281148c04932d02bef2.
/// @param sourceNttManager The address of the source nttManager.
/// @param msgHash The keccak-256 hash of the message.
event MessageAlreadyExecuted(bytes32 indexed sourceNttManager, bytes32 indexed msgHash);
```

#### Mint or Unlock

Once a transfer has been successfully verified, the tokens can be minted (if the mode is "burning") or unlocked (if the mode is "locking") to the recipient on the destination chain. Note that the source token decimals are bounded between `0` and `TRIMMED_DECIMALS` as enforced in the wire format. The transfer amount is untrimmed (scaled-up) if the destination chain token decimals exceed `TRIMMED_DECIMALS`. Once the appropriate number of tokens have been minted or unlocked to the recipient, the `TransferRedeemed` event is emitted.

**Events**

```ts
/// @notice Emitted when a transfer has been redeemed
/// (either minted or unlocked on the recipient chain).
/// @dev Topic0
/// 0x504e6efe18ab9eed10dc6501a417f5b12a2f7f2b1593aed9b89f9bce3cf29a91.
/// @param digest The digest of the message.
event TransferRedeemed(bytes32 indexed digest);
```

### Solana

#### Transfer

A client calls the `transfer_lock` or `transfer_burn` instruction based on whether the program is in `LOCKING` or `BURNING` mode. The program mode is set during initialization. When transferring, the client must specify the amount of the transfer, the recipient chain, the recipient address on the recipient chain, and the boolean flag `should_queue` to specify whether the transfer should be queued if it hits the outbound rate limit. If `should_queue` is set to false, the transfer reverts instead of queuing if the rate limit were to be hit.

!!! note
    Using the wrong transfer instruction, i.e. `transfer_lock` for a program that is in `BURNING` mode, will result in an `InvalidMode` error.

Depending on the mode and instruction, the following will be produced in the program logs:

```ts
Program log: Instruction: TransferLock
Program log: Instruction: TransferBurn
```

Outbound transfers are always added to an Outbox via the `insert_into_outbox` method. This method checks the transfer against the configured outbound rate limit amount to determine whether the transfer should be rate-limited. An `OutboxItem` is a Solana Account that holds details of the outbound transfer. The transfer can be released from the Outbox immediately if no rate limit is hit. The transfer can be released from the Outbox immediately unless a rate limit is hit, in which case it will only be released after the delay duration associated with the rate limit has expired.

#### Rate Limit

During the transfer process, the program checks rate limits via the `consume_or_delay` function. The Solana rate-limiting logic is equivalent to the EVM rate-limiting logic.

If the transfer amount fits within the current capacity:

- Reduce the current capacity
- Refill the inbound capacity for the destination chain
- Add the transfer to the Outbox with `release_timestamp` set to the current timestamp, so it can be released immediately.

If the transfer amount doesn't fit within the current capacity:

- If `shouldQueue = true`, add the transfer to the Outbox with `release_timestamp` set to the current timestamp plus the configured `RATE_LIMIT_DURATION`.
- If `shouldQueue = false`, revert with a `TransferExceedsRateLimit` error

#### Send

The caller then needs to request each transceiver to send messages via the `release_outbound` instruction. To execute this instruction, the caller needs to pass the account of the Outbox item to be released. The instruction will then verify that the transceiver is one of the specified senders for the message. Transceivers then send the messages based on the verification backend they are using.

For example, the Wormhole transceiver will send by calling `post_message` on the Wormhole program, so that the Wormhole Guardians can observe and verify the message.

!!! note
    When `revert_on_delay` is true, the transaction will revert if the release timestamp hasn't been reached. When `revert_on_delay` is false, the transaction succeeds, but the outbound release isn't performed.

The following will be produced in the program logs:

```ts
Program log: Instruction: ReleaseOutbound
```

#### Receive

Similar to EVM, transceivers vary in how they receive messages since message relaying and verification methods may differ between implementations.

The Wormhole transceiver receives a verified Wormhole message on Solana via the `receive_message` entrypoint instruction. Callers can use the `receive_wormhole_message` Anchor library function to execute this instruction. The instruction verifies the Wormhole Verified Action Approvals (VAAs) and stores it in a `VerifiedTransceiverMessage` account.

The following will be produced in the program logs:

```ts
Program log: Instruction: ReceiveMessage
```

`redeem` checks the inbound rate limit and places the message in an Inbox. Logic works the same as the outbound rate limit mentioned previously.

The following will be produced in the program logs:

```ts
Program log: Instruction: Redeem
```

#### Mint or Unlock

The inbound transfer is released and the tokens are unlocked or minted to the recipient through either `release_inbound_mint` if the mode is `BURNING`, or `release_inbound_unlock` if the mode is `LOCKING`. Similar to transfer, using the wrong transfer instruction (such as `release_inbound_mint` for a program that is in locking mode) will result in `InvalidMode` error.

!!! note
    When `revert_on_delay` is true, the transaction will revert if the release timestamp hasn't been reached. When `revert_on_delay` is false, the transaction succeeds, but the minting/unlocking isn't performed.

Depending on the mode and instruction, the following will be produced in the program logs:

```ts
Program log: Instruction: ReleaseInboundMint
Program log: Instruction: ReleaseInboundUnlock
```

# Wormhole Settlement FAQs

## Can I use Wormhole Settlement from a smart contract? If so, how is a message signed and relayed?

Yes, Wormhole Settlement can be used from a smart contract. The composing protocol's relayer relays the message. For example, Mayan Shuttle (formerly Swap Layer) has a relayer that redeems the VAA on the destination chain to mint USDC and execute the `callData` contained in the payload.

## What happens if no solver participates in the auction?

If an auction does not start within the specified deadline, a standard CCTP transfer will proceed directly from the source chain to the destination chain. This is why parameters like `deadline` exist in the token router interface, ensuring a fallback mechanism in case no solver participates.

## What guarantees does Wormhole Settlement provide for message execution?

After the user receives the token upfront, the execution of additional contract calls depends on the relayer of the composing protocol. For example, in Mayan Shuttle, the relayer will attempt the swap multiple times, but its success is subject to the parameters defined in the `callData` (e.g., slippage).

If the slippage tolerance is set too low, the user may receive USDC on the destination chain instead of the intended swap outcome. However, the four basis points (bps) fee is non-refundable, as the service provided by Liquidity Layer (LL) solvers (ensuring front-finality) is separate from the composing protocol's services, such as swaps or deposits.

# Build on the Wormhole Liquidity Layer

## Introduction

The Wormhole Liquidity Layer is the underlying chain abstraction infrastructure layer for protocols across Wormhole-connected ecosystems. It allows these protocols to bundle call data containing arbitrary actions that can be executed atomically alongside each transfer. This feature enables developers to create fully chain-abstracted user experiences, including constructing natively cross-chain decentralized exchanges (DEXs), borrow-lend protocols, payment protocols, and other applications atop this layer. The following section describes the key smart contract components for teams seeking to build atop Wormhole Settlement.

## EVM Functions

The EVM Token Router is a simple interface against which to integrate. For an integrator, the contracts have two main entry points: `placeMarketOrder` and `placeFastMarketOrder`.

### Fast Market Order

The `placeFastMarketOrder` function allows the caller to elect for a _faster-than-finality_ transfer of USDC (with an arbitrary message payload) to the destination chain by setting the `maxFee` and `deadline` parameters. Using this interface does not guarantee that the caller's transfer will be delivered faster than finality; however, any willing market participants can compete for the specified `maxFee` by participating in an auction on the Solana `MatchingEngine`

```solidity title="`placeFastMarketOrder` Interface"
function placeFastMarketOrder(
    uint128 amountIn,
    uint16 targetChain,
    bytes32 redeemer,
    bytes calldata redeemerMessage,
    uint128 maxFee,
    uint32 deadline
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence, uint64 fastSequence);
```

??? interface "Parameters `placeFastMarketOrder()`"

    `amountIn` ++"uint128"++

    The amount to transfer.

    ---

    `targetChain` ++"uint16"++

    Target chain ID.

    ---

    `redeemer` ++"bytes32"++

    Redeemer contract address.

    ---

    `redeemerMessage` ++"bytes"++

    An arbitrary payload for the redeemer.

    ---

    `maxFee` ++"uint128"++

    The maximum fee the user wants to pay to execute a fast transfer.

    ---

    `deadline` ++"uint32"++

    The deadline for the fast transfer auction to start. Note: This timestamp should be for the `MatchingEngine` chain (such as Solana) to avoid any clock drift issues between different blockchains. Integrators can set this value to `0` if they don't want to use a deadline.

The `placeFastMarketOrder` function returns a sequence number for the Wormhole Fill message. This function requires the caller to provide a `msg.value` equal to the amount returned by the `messageFee()` function on the `IWormhole.sol` interface.

### Market Order

The `placeMarketOrder` function is a _wait-for-full-finality_ USDC transfer with an arbitrary message payload. The Swap Layer, built on top of the Wormhole Settlement, uses this function if the auction on the matching engine for `placeFastMarketOrder` doesn't start within a specific deadline.

```solidity title="`placeMarketOrder` Interface"
function placeMarketOrder(
    uint128 amountIn,
    uint16 targetChain,
    bytes32 redeemer,
    bytes calldata redeemerMessage,
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence, uint64 protocolSequence);
```

??? interface "Parameters `placeMarketOrder()`"

    `amountIn` ++"uint128"++

    The amount to transfer.

    ---

    `targetChain` ++"uint16"++

    Target chain ID.

    ---

    `redeemer` ++"bytes32"++

    Redeemer contract address.

    ---

    `redeemerMessage` ++"bytes"++

    An arbitrary payload for the redeemer.

The `placeMarketOrder` function returns a sequence number for the Wormhole Fill message. This function requires the caller to provide a `msg.value` equal to the amount returned by the `messageFee()` function on the `IWormhole.sol` interface.

# Run a Wormhole Settlement Solver

## Introduction

This page provides instructions on how to set up, configure, and run a Solver for Wormhole Settlement using the [example solver](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-liquidity-layer/tree/update-solver-example/solver){target=\_blank}. 

A Solver is an off-chain agent responsible for:

- Listening to cross-chain transfer requests sent over Wormhole
- Bidding in auctions (on Solana) to fulfill each request
- Facilitating the actual cross-chain transfer by locking/burning assets on Solana and minting/unlocking them on the destination chain
- Rebalancing once the origin chain transaction finalizes and is redeemed back on Solana

For information on how the protocol functions and its core features, please visit the [Wormhole Settlement](/docs/learn/transfers/settlement/overview/){target=\_blank} page.

## Background

The Solana Matching Engine's permissionless English auction is a central component of Wormhole Settlement protocol architecture. The Matching Engine contract allows any third-party solver to interact with the matching engine to place bids or improve existing ones. The contract includes four key instructions:

1. `initialize_auction` - creates a new auction account on-chain and sets basic parameters like the auction's token mint, the amount required, and the bidding period details
2. `bid` - allows a solver to place or update a bid on the active auction
3. `finalize_auction` - following the conclusion of the auction, this instruction completes the fast transfer by sending funds to the recipient on the target chain. This instruction may call the Circle CCTP contract or release an NTT contract in the future, depending on the shuttle asset in question. Failure to execute this message within a predefined grace period may result in a penalty for the winning bidder.
4. `cancel_auction` - cancels an open auction when the auction is no longer valid or was created by mistake. The program returns all locked funds to their respective owners

These instructions work together to carry out the auction as follows:

- The solver transfers the bid amount to the program escrow account, which ensures they have liquidity 
- With each successful call of `bid`, the program updates the auction to the new highest bidder, and the prior bid is atomically sent back to the originating solver 
- The originating solver can repurpose the returned funds and use them to improve their bid
- Following the auction, the winning solver has to call an instruction on the matching engine to execute the intent

When placing a bid, whether initial or improved, the solver must deposit the required funds plus a security deposit into the matching engine contract. In this permissionless auction, the requirement of this principal amount plus the security deposit ensures a solver's credible commitment to fulfill the transfer. Malicious actors could place hollow bids without this safeguard, undermining the auction's credibility and hindering true price discovery.

If the winning solver fails to call the `finalize_auction` instruction, other competing solvers may permissionlessly 'slash' the solver by executing the instruction on their behalf and collecting a portion of the original security deposit as a reward. The remaining portion is routed to the user as compensation for the unanticipated delay. This mechanism properly incentivizes timely execution through solver redundancy and competition.

## Testnet Example Solver

You can clone the Wormhole [`example-liquidity-layer`](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-liquidity-layer){target=\_blank} repository to use the included [`solver`](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-liquidity-layer/tree/main/solver){target=\_blank} directory as an example solver to fulfill fast orders by interacting with the Matching Engine on Solana.

!!!warning
    This example is not optimized for performance, has only been tested on Solana devnet, and is not intended for production use. Any assumptions made in this example may not translate to mainnet.

### Prerequisites

In order to build and install dependencies locally in this repo, you will need: 

- node v20.18.1
- npmv - get started by installing `nvm` using this [installation guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating){target=\_blank}

Navigate into the `solver` directory, then run the command below to set up your environment and install the node dependencies and Matching Engine package:

```sh
make dependencies
```

### Set up Config

The following is an example of a `config.json` file for Solana devnet. The keys here are required for both the publisher and example solver processes.

      "rollbackRisk": 0.0069,
      "offerEdge": 0.042
    }
  ]
}
```

The rollback risks and offer edges configured in the sample config are arbitrary placeholders. You should use historical data and your risk tolerance, to determine appropriate values for your project.

### Listen to Activity

The example solver listens to attested Wormhole messages (VAAs) published on the Wormhole Guardian gossip network. To listen to this gossip network and run the VAA publisher, run the command below. Docker compose is used to listen to the Pyth Beacon and start the [`publishActivity`](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-liquidity-layer/blob/update-solver-example/solver/app/publishActivity.ts){target=\_blank} process.

```sh
NETWORK=testnet CONFIG=path/to/config.json make run-publisher
```

You should see output resembling:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
	<span data-ty> Start logging with info level.</span>
	<span data-ty> 2025-01-21 16:38:28.145 [publisher] info: Environment: Testnet</span>
	<span data-ty> 2025-01-21 16:38:36.631 [publisher] info: Fast VAA. chain=OptimismSepolia, sequence=33635, vaaTime=1737499116</span>
	<span data-ty> 2025-01-21 16:38:51.044 [publisher] info: Fast VAA. chain=OptimismSepolia, sequence=33637, vaaTime=1737499130</span>
  <span data-ty> 2025-01-21 16:40:24.890 [publisher] info: Fast VAA. chain=OptimismSepolia, sequence=33639, vaaTime=1737499224</span>
</div>

To set up the Pyth Beacon (which is run using make `run-publisher`), you may need to increase the UDP buffer size for the OS:

=== "Linux"

    ```sh
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2097152
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=2097152
    ```

=== "MacOS"

    ```sh
    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.udp.recvspace=2097152
    ```

### Running the Example Solver

Using the same config for your publisher, run the example solver with the command below.

```sh
CONFIG=path/to/config.json make run-solver
```

It is recommended you write log output to a file so errors can be tracked. The example config above specifies an example log filename.

This process reads the following environment variables:

```sh
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY_1=
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY_2=
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY_3=
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY_4=
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY_5=
```

At least one of these environment variables must be defined as a keypair encoded in base64 format. These payers must have SOL to send transactions on Solana devnet. If they need funds, they can request them from the [Solana devnet faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/){target=\_blank}.

The example solver assumes that these payers own USDC Associated Token Accounts(ATAs), which will be used to fulfill fast transfers. These ATAs must be funded with Solana Devnet USDC. If your ATAs need funds, request some at the [Circle testnet faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/){target=\_blank}.

Wallets and their corresponding ATA will be disabled if there are insufficient funds to pay for transactions or fulfill fast transfers. These constraints can be modified using the `updatePayerMinimumLamports` and `updateTokenMinimumBalance` methods.

An address lookup table is required to execute some transactions. Use the command below to create one.

```sh
CONFIG=path/to/config.json make create-lut
```

`SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY_1` must be defined for this script to work.

The example solver has the following toggles depending on which orders you want to fulfill:

- `enableCctpOrderPipeline()`
- `enableLocalOrderPipeline()`
- `enablePlaceInitialOffer()`
- `enableImproveOffer()`

See the comments in [runExampleSolver](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-liquidity-layer/blob/update-solver-example/solver/app/runExampleSolver.ts){target=\_blank} for more information.

This example solver does NOT do the following:

- Discriminate between the CCTP source networks. You must add logic to determine whether you want to constrain fulfilling orders from specific networks. This solver will try to fulfill all orders as long as `enableCctpOrderPipeline()` is called
- Discriminate among fulfillment sizes. No logic determines how small or large fast order transfer sizes should be. This solver will try to fulfill anything as long as your balance can handle it
- Add auctions to auction history. We recommend that after settling a complete auction (one that you have won), you write the auction pubkey to a database and have a separate process to add auction history entries to reclaim rent from these auction accounts. The auction history time delay is two hours after the VAA timestamp. This example does not prescribe any specific database, so add whichever you want

description: Learn how to integrate Wormhole's Token Bridge for seamless multichain token transfers with a lock-and-mint mechanism and cross-chain asset management.
---

# Token Bridge

## Introduction 

Wormhole's Token Bridge enables seamless cross-chain token transfers using a lock-and-mint mechanism. The bridge locks tokens on the source chain and mints them as wrapped assets on the destination chain. Additionally, the Token Bridge supports [Token Transfers with Messages](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/#token-transfer-with-message){target=\_blank}, where arbitrary byte payloads can be attached to the token transfer, enabling more complex chain interactions. 

This page outlines the core contract methods needed to integrate Token Bridge functionality into your smart contracts. To understand the theoretical workings of the Token Bridge, refer to the [Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/){target=\_blank} page in the Learn section. 

## Prerequisites

To interact with the Wormhole Token Bridge, you'll need the following:

- [The address of the Token Bridge contract](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#token-bridge){target=\_blank} on the chains you're working with
- [The Wormhole chain ID](/docs/build/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} of the chains you're targeting for token transfers

## How to Interact with Token Bridge Contracts

The primary functions of the Token Bridge contracts revolve around:

- **Attesting a token** - registering a new token for cross-chain transfers
- **Transferring tokens** - locking and minting tokens across chains
- **Transferring tokens with a payload** - including additional data with transfers

### Attest a token

Suppose a token has never been transferred to the target chain before transferring it cross-chain. In that case, its metadata must be registered so the Token Bridge can recognize it and create a wrapped version if necessary.

The attestation process doesn't require you to manually input token details like name, symbol, or decimals. Instead, the Token Bridge contract retrieves these values from the token contract itself when you call the `attestToken()` method.

```solidity
function attestToken(
    address tokenAddress,
    uint32 nonce
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `tokenAddress` ++"address"++
        
    The contract address of the token to be attested.

    ---

    `nonce` ++"uint32"++  

    An arbitrary value provided by the caller to ensure uniqueness.

??? interface "Returns"

    `sequence` ++"uint64"++
    
    A unique identifier for the attestation transaction.

When `attestToken()` is called, the contract emits a Verifiable Action Approval (VAA) containing the token's metadata, which the Guardians sign and publish.

You must ensure the token is ERC-20 compliant. If it does not implement the standard functions, the attestation may fail or produce incomplete metadata.

### Transfer Tokens 

Once a token is attested, a cross-chain token transfer can be initiated following the lock-and-mint mechanism. On the source chain, tokens are locked (or burned if they're already a wrapped asset), and a VAA is emitted. On the destination chain, that VAA is used to mint or release the corresponding amount of wrapped tokens.

Call `transferTokens()` to lock/burn tokens and produce a VAA with transfer details.

```solidity
function transferTokens(
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint16 recipientChain,
    bytes32 recipient,
    uint256 arbiterFee,
    uint32 nonce
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `token` ++"address"++
        
    The address of the token being transferred.

    ---

    `amount` ++"uint256"++  
    The amount of tokens to be transferred.

    ---

    `recipientChain` ++"uint16"++  
    The Wormhole chain ID of the destination chain.

    ---

    `recipient` ++"bytes32"++  
    The recipient's address on the destination chain.

    ---

    `arbiterFee` ++"uint256"++  
    Optional fee to be paid to an arbiter for relaying the transfer.

    ---

    `nonce` ++"uint32"++  
    A unique identifier for the transaction.

??? interface "Returns"

    `sequence` ++"uint64"++
    
    A unique identifier for the transfer transaction.

Once a transfer VAA is obtained from the Wormhole Guardian network, the final step is to redeem the tokens on the destination chain. Redemption verifies the VAA's authenticity and releases (or mints) tokens to the specified recipient. To redeem the tokens, call `completeTransfer()`.

```solidity
function completeTransfer(bytes memory encodedVm) external;
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `encodedVm` ++"bytes memory"++
    
    The signed VAA containing the transfer details.

!!!note
    - The Token Bridge normalizes token amounts to 8 decimals when passing them between chains. Make sure your application accounts for potential decimal truncation
    - The VAA ensures the integrity of the message. Only after the Guardians sign the VAA can it be redeemed on the destination chain

### Transfer tokens with payload

While a standard token transfer moves tokens between chains, a transfer with a payload allows you to embed arbitrary data in the VAA. This data can be used on the destination chain to execute additional logic—such as automatically depositing tokens into a DeFi protocol, initiating a swap on a DEX, or interacting with a custom smart contract.

Call `transferTokensWithPayload()` instead of `transferTokens()` to include a custom payload (arbitrary bytes) with the token transfer.

```solidity
function transferTokensWithPayload(
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint16 recipientChain,
    bytes32 recipient,
    uint32 nonce,
    bytes memory payload
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `token` ++"address"++
    
    The address of the token being transferred.

    ---

    `amount` ++"uint256"++  
    The amount of tokens to be transferred.

    ---

    `recipientChain` ++"uint16"++  
    The Wormhole chain ID of the destination chain.

    ---

    `recipient` ++"bytes32"++  
    The recipient's address on the destination chain.

    ---

    `nonce` ++"uint32"++  
    A unique identifier for the transaction.

    ---

    `payload` ++"bytes memory"++  
    Arbitrary data payload attached to the transaction.

??? interface "Returns"
    
    `sequence` ++"uint64"++
    
    A unique identifier for the transfer transaction.

After initiating a transfer on the source chain, the Wormhole Guardian network observes and signs the resulting message, creating a Verifiable Action Approval (VAA). You'll need to fetch this VAA and then call `completeTransferWithPayload()`.

Only the designated recipient contract can redeem tokens. This ensures that the intended contract securely handles the attached payload. On successful redemption, the tokens are minted (if foreign) or released (if native) to the recipient address on the destination chain. For payload transfers, the designated contract can execute the payload's logic at this time.

```solidity
function completeTransferWithPayload(bytes memory encodedVm) external returns (bytes memory);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `encodedVm` ++"bytes memory"++

    The signed VAA containing the transfer details.

??? interface "Returns"

    `bytes memory`

    The extracted payload data.

## Portal Bridge

A practical implementation of the Wormhole Token Bridge can be seen in [Portal Bridge](https://portalbridge.com/){target=\_blank}, which provides an easy-to-use interface for transferring tokens across multiple blockchain networks. It leverages the Wormhole infrastructure to handle cross-chain asset transfers seamlessly, offering users a convenient way to bridge their assets while ensuring security and maintaining token integrity.

## FAQs

### Can ownership of wrapped tokens be transferred from the Token Bridge?

No, you cannot transfer ownership of wrapped token contracts from the [Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/){target=\_blank} because the Token Bridge deploys and retains ownership of these contracts and tokens.

 - **On EVM chains** - when you attest a token, the Token Bridge deploys a new ERC-20 contract as a beacon proxy. The upgrade authority for these contracts is the Token Bridge contract itself
 - **On Solana** - the Token Bridge deploys a new SPL token, where the upgrade authority is a Program Derived Address (PDA) controlled by the Token Bridge

The logic behind deploying these token contracts involves submitting an attestation VAA, which allows the Token Bridge to verify and deploy the wrapped token contract on the destination chain.

Relevant contracts:

 - [Ethereum ERC-20](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/bridge/token/Token.sol){target=\_blank}
 - [Solana SPL](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/solana/modules/token_bridge/program/src/api/create_wrapped.rs#L128-L145){target=\_blank}
 - [Attestation VAA and Token Contract Deployment Logic](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/bridge/Bridge.sol#L385-L431){target=\_blank}

### How do I update the metadata of a wrapped token?

Because wrapped tokens are deployed and controlled by the Token Bridge program, which is under the authority of the Wormhole Guardians, there is no direct way for you to update their metadata. Instead, you must coordinate with the respective block explorer teams to request and apply metadata changes.

### How do I calculate the current gas costs for Ethereum Mainnet VAA verification?

You can refer to the [core-bridge repository](https://github.com/nonergodic/core-bridge){target=\_blank} for guidance on how to calculate the current gas costs associated with verifying VAAs on Ethereum Mainnet. This repository provides up-to-date references and examples to help you gauge costs accurately.

### How can I update my wrapped token image on Solscan?

Updating the metadata (such as the token image, name, or symbol) of a wrapped token on [Solscan](https://solscan.io/){target=\_blank} requires [contacting the Solscan team](https://solscan.io/contactus){target=\_blank} directly. Wormhole cannot make these updates for you because the wrapped token contracts are owned and controlled by the Token Bridge, not individual developers or projects.

description: Learn how to build and configure your own off-chain custom relaying solution to relay Wormhole messages for your applications using the Relayer Engine.

# Run a Custom Relayer

## Introduction

Relayers play a crucial role in cross-chain communication, ensuring that messages are transferred seamlessly between different blockchains. While Wormhole relayers provide a reliable way to handle these transfers, they might not always meet every application's unique requirements.

Custom relayers address these limitations by offering tailored solutions that cater to the distinct needs of your application. Developing a custom relayer gives you complete control over message processing, delivery mechanisms, and integration with existing systems. This customization allows for optimized performance and the ability to implement specific features that Wormhole-deployed relayers might not support.

A custom relayer might be as simple as an in-browser process that polls the API for the availability of a VAA after submitting a transaction and delivers it to the target chain. It might also be implemented with a Spy coupled with some daemon listening for VAAs from a relevant chain ID and emitter, then taking action when one is observed.

This guide teaches you how to set up and configure a custom relayer for efficient message handling. You'll start by understanding how to uniquely identify a VAA using its emitter address, sequence ID, and chain ID. Then, you'll explore the Relayer Engine, a package that provides a framework for building custom relayers, and learn how to fetch and handle VAAs using the Wormhole SDK.

## Get Started with a Custom Relayer

To start building a custom relayer, it's essential to grasp the components you'll be managing as part of your relaying service. Your relayer must be capable of retrieving and delivering VAAs.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Custom relayer](/docs/images/infrastructure/relayers/run-relayer/relayer-1.webp)
  <figcaption>The off-chain components outlined in blue must be implemented.</figcaption>
</figure>

### How to Uniquely Identify a VAA

Regardless of the environment, to get the VAA you intend to relay, you need:

- The `emitter` address
- The `sequence` ID of the message you're interested in
- The `chainId` for the chain that emitted the message

With these three components, you're able to uniquely identify a VAA and process it.

## Use the Relayer Engine

The [`relayer-engine`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine){target=\_blank} is a package that provides the structure and a starting point for a custom relayer.

With the Relayer Engine, a developer can write specific logic for filtering to receive only the messages they care about.

Once a Wormhole message is received, the developer may apply additional logic to parse custom payloads or submit the Verifiable Action Approvals (VAA) to one or many destination chains.

To use the Relayer Engine, a developer may specify how to relay Wormhole messages for their app using an idiomatic Express/Koa middleware-inspired API, then let the library handle all the details.

### Install the Relayer Engine

First, install the `relayer-engine` package with your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm i @wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine
```

### Get Started with the Relayer Engine

In the following example, you'll:

1. Set up a `StandardRelayerApp`, passing configuration options for our relayer
2. Add a filter to capture only those messages our app cares about, with a callback to do _something_ with the VAA once received
3. Start the relayer app

```typescript
import {
  Environment,
  StandardRelayerApp,
  StandardRelayerContext,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine';
import { CHAIN_ID_SOLANA } from '@certusone/wormhole-sdk';

(async function main() {
  // Initialize relayer engine app and pass relevant config options
  const app = new StandardRelayerApp<StandardRelayerContext>(
    Environment.TESTNET,
    // Other app specific config options can be set here for things
    // like retries, logger, or redis connection settings
    {
      name: 'ExampleRelayer',
    }
  );

  // Add a filter with a callback that will be invoked
  // on finding a VAA that matches the filter
  app.chain(CHAIN_ID_SOLANA).address(
    // Emitter address on Solana
    'DZnkkTmCiFWfYTfT41X3Rd1kDgozqzxWaHqsw6W4x2oe',
    // Callback function to invoke on new message
    async (ctx, next) => {
      const vaa = ctx.vaa;
      const hash = ctx.sourceTxHash;
      console.log(
        `Got a VAA with sequence: ${vaa.sequence} from with txhash: ${hash}`
      );
    }
  );

  // Add and configure any other middleware here

  // Start app. Blocks until unrecoverable error or process is stopped
  await app.listen();
})();
```

The first meaningful line instantiates the `StandardRelayerApp`, a subclass of the `RelayerApp` with standard defaults.

```typescript
export class StandardRelayerApp<
  ContextT extends StandardRelayerContext = StandardRelayerContext,
> extends RelayerApp<ContextT> {
  // ...
  constructor(env: Environment, opts: StandardRelayerAppOpts) {
```

The only field you pass in the `StandardRelayerAppOpts` is the name to help identify log messages and reserve a namespace in Redis.

??? code "`StandardRelayerAppOpts`"

    Other options can be passed to the `StandardRelayerApp` constructor to configure the app further.

    ```typescript
    wormholeRpcs?: string[];  // List of URLs from which to query missed VAAs
concurrency?: number;     // How many concurrent requests to make for workflows
spyEndpoint?: string;     // The hostname and port of our Spy
logger?: Logger;          // A custom Logger
privateKeys?: Partial<{ [k in ChainId]: any[]; }>; // A set of keys that can be used to sign and send transactions
tokensByChain?: TokensByChain;    // The token list we care about
workflows?: { retries: number; }; // How many times to retry a given workflow
providers?: ProvidersOpts;        // Configuration for the default providers
fetchSourceTxhash?: boolean;      // whether or not to get the original transaction ID/hash
// Redis config
redisClusterEndpoints?: ClusterNode[];
redisCluster?: ClusterOptions;
redis?: RedisOptions;
    ```

The next meaningful line in the example adds a filter middleware component. This middleware will cause the relayer app to request a subscription from the Spy for any VAAs that match the criteria and invoke the callback with the VAA.

If you'd like your program to subscribe to `multiple` chains and addresses, you can call the same method several times or use the `multiple` helper.

```typescript
app.multiple(
  {
    [CHAIN_ID_SOLANA]: 'DZnkkTmCiFWfYTfT41X3Rd1kDgozqzxWaHqsw6W4x2oe',
    [CHAIN_ID_ETH]: ['0xabc1230000000...', '0xdef456000...'],
  },
  myCallback
);
```

The last line in the simple example runs `await app.listen()`, which starts the relayer engine. Once started, the Relayer Engine issues subscription requests to the Spy and begins any other workflows (e.g., tracking missed VAAs).

This will run until the process is killed or encounters an unrecoverable error. To gracefully shut down the relayer, call `app.stop()`.

The source code for this example is available in the [`relayer-engine` repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine/blob/main/examples/simple/src/app.ts){target=\_blank}.

## Start Background Processes

!!! note
    These processes _must_ be running for the relayer app below to work.

Next, you must start a Spy to listen for available VAAs published on the Guardian network. You also need a persistence layer. This example uses Redis.

More details about the Spy are available in the [Spy Documentation](/docs/learn/infrastructure/spy){target=\_blank}.

### Wormhole Network Spy

For our relayer app to receive messages, a local Spy must be running that watches the Guardian network. Our relayer app will receive updates from this Spy.

=== "Mainnet Spy"

    ```bash
    docker run --pull=always --platform=linux/amd64 \
    -p 7073:7073 \
    --entrypoint /guardiand ghcr.io/wormhole-foundation/guardiand:latest \
    spy \
    --nodeKey /node.key \
    --spyRPC "[::]:7073" \
    --env mainnet
    ```

=== "Testnet Spy"

    ```bash
    docker run --pull=always --platform=linux/amd64 \
    -p 7073:7073 \
    --entrypoint /guardiand ghcr.io/wormhole-foundation/guardiand:latest \
    spy \
    --nodeKey /node.key \
    --spyRPC "[::]:7073" \
    --env testnet   
    ```

### Redis Persistence

!!! note
    While you're using [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/get-started/){target=\_blank} here, the persistence layer can be swapped out for some other database by implementing the appropriate [interface](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine/blob/main/relayer/storage/redis-storage.ts){target=\_blank}.

A Redis instance must also be available to persist job data for fetching VAAs from the Spy.

```bash
docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 --name redis-docker -d redis
```

## Use the Wormhole SDK

You can also use the Wormhole SDK to poll the Guardian RPC until a signed VAA is ready using the SDK's `getSignedVAAWithRetry` function.

```ts
import {
  getSignedVAAWithRetry,
  parseVAA,
  CHAIN_ID_SOLANA,
  CHAIN_ID_ETH,
} from '@certusone/wormhole-sdk';

const RPC_HOSTS = [
  /* ...*/
];

async function getVAA(
  emitter: string,
  sequence: string,
  chainId: number
): Promise<Uint8Array> {
  // Wait for the VAA to be ready and fetch it from the guardian network
  const { vaaBytes } = await getSignedVAAWithRetry(
    RPC_HOSTS,
    chainId,
    emitter,
    sequence
  );
  return vaaBytes;
}

const vaaBytes = await getVAA('INSERT_EMITTER_ADDRESS', 1, CHAIN_ID_ETH);
```

Once you have the VAA, the delivery method is chain-dependent.

=== "EVM"

    On EVM chains, the bytes for the VAA can be passed directly as an argument to an ABI method.

    ```ts
    // Set up eth wallet
const ethProvider = new ethers.providers.StaticJsonRpcProvider(
  'INSERT_RPC_URL'
);
const ethWallet = new ethers.Wallet('INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY', ethProvider);

// Create client to interact with our target app
const ethHelloWorld = HelloWorld__factory.connect(
  'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
  ethWallet
);

// Invoke the receiveMessage on the ETH contract and wait for confirmation
const receipt = await ethHelloWorld
  .receiveMessage(vaaBytes)
  .then((tx: ethers.ContractTransaction) => tx.wait())
  .catch((msg: any) => {
    console.error(msg);
    return null;
  });
    ```

=== "Solana"

    On Solana, the VAA is first posted to the core bridge, and then a custom transaction is prepared to process and validate the VAA. 

    ```ts
    import { CONTRACTS } from '@certusone/wormhole-sdk';

export const WORMHOLE_CONTRACTS = CONTRACTS[NETWORK];
export const CORE_BRIDGE_PID = new PublicKey(WORMHOLE_CONTRACTS.solana.core);

// First, post the VAA to the core bridge
await postVaaSolana(
  connection,
  wallet.signTransaction,
  CORE_BRIDGE_PID,
  wallet.key(),
  vaaBytes
);

const program = createHelloWorldProgramInterface(connection, programId);
const parsed = isBytes(wormholeMessage)
  ? parseVaa(wormholeMessage)
  : wormholeMessage;

const ix = program.methods
  .receiveMessage([...parsed.hash])
  .accounts({
    payer: new PublicKey(payer),
    config: deriveConfigKey(programId),
    wormholeProgram: new PublicKey(wormholeProgramId),
    posted: derivePostedVaaKey(wormholeProgramId, parsed.hash),
    foreignEmitter: deriveForeignEmitterKey(programId, parsed.emitterChain),
    received: deriveReceivedKey(
      programId,
      parsed.emitterChain,
      parsed.sequence
    ),
  })
  .instruction();

const transaction = new Transaction().add(ix);
const { blockhash } = await connection.getLatestBlockhash(commitment);
transaction.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
transaction.feePayer = new PublicKey(payerAddress);

const signed = await wallet.signTxn(transaction);
const txid = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signed);

await connection.confirmTransaction(txid);
    ```

# Run a Spy

## Introduction

The Spy is a lightweight component in the Wormhole infrastructure designed to listen for and forward messages (Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)) published on the Wormhole network. Running a Spy locally allows developers to subscribe to a filtered stream of these messages, facilitating the development of custom relayers or other integrations with Wormhole.

For a more comprehensive understanding of the Spy and its role within the Wormhole ecosystem, refer to the [Spy Documentation](/docs/learn/infrastructure/spy/){target=\_blank}.

## How to Start a Spy

To start a Spy locally, run the following Docker command:

=== "Mainnet"

    ```sh
    docker run --pull=always --platform=linux/amd64 \
        -p 7073:7073 \
        --entrypoint /guardiand ghcr.io/wormhole-foundation/guardiand:latest \
        spy \
        --nodeKey /node.key \
        --spyRPC "[::]:7073" \
        --env mainnet
    ```

=== "Testnet"

    ```sh
    docker run --pull=always --platform=linux/amd64 \
        -p 7073:7073 \
        --entrypoint /guardiand ghcr.io/wormhole-foundation/guardiand:latest \
        spy \
        --nodeKey /node.key \
        --spyRPC "[::]:7073" \
        --env testnet
    ```

If you want to run the Spy built from source, change `ghcr.io/wormhole-foundation/guardiand:latest` to `guardian` after building the `guardian` image.

Optionally, add the following flags to skip any VAAs with invalid signatures:

=== "Mainnet"

    ```sh
    --ethRPC https://eth.drpc.org
    --ethContract 0x98f3c9e6E3fAce36bAAd05FE09d375Ef1464288B
    ```

=== "Testnet"

    ```sh
    --ethRPC https://sepolia.drpc.org/
    --ethContract 0x4a8bc80Ed5a4067f1CCf107057b8270E0cC11A78    
    ```

Optionally, add the following flags to prevent unbounded log growth:

```sh
--log-opt max-size=10m \
--log-opt max-file=3
```

## Subscribe to Filtered VAAs

Once running, a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/){target=\_blank} client (i.e., your program) can subscribe to a filtered stream of messages (VAAs).

Use this [proto-spec file](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/proto/spy/v1/spy.proto){target=\_blank} to generate a client for the gRPC service.

!!! note
    If using JavaScript/TypeScript, the [Spydk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@certusone/wormhole-spydk){target=\_blank} makes setting up a client easier.

## Data Persistence

The Spy does not have a built-in persistence layer, so it is typically paired with something like Redis or an SQL database to record relevant messages.

The persistence layer needs to implement the appropriate interface. For example, you can check out the [Redis interface](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine/blob/main/relayer/storage/redis-storage.ts){target=\_blank} used by the Relayer Engine, a package that implements a client and persistence layer for messages received from a Spy subscription.

# Glossary

This glossary is an index of technical term definitions for words commonly used in Wormhole documentation.

## Chain ID

Wormhole assigns a unique `u16` integer chain ID to each supported blockchain. These chain IDs are specific to Wormhole and may differ from those used by blockchains to identify their networks.

You can find each chain ID documented on the [Wormhole Chain IDs](/docs/build/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} page.

## Consistency Level

The level of finality (consistency) a transaction should meet before being signed by a Guardian. See the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} reference page for details.

## Delivery Provider

A Delivery Provider monitors for Wormhole Relayer delivery requests and delivers those requests to the intended target chain as instructed.

## Emitter

The emitter contract makes the call to the Wormhole Core Contract. The published message includes the emitter contract address and, a sequence number for the message is tracked to provide a unique ID.

## Finality

The finality of a transaction depends on its blockchain properties. Once a transaction is considered final, you can assume the resulting state changes it caused won't be reverted.

## Guardian

A [Guardian](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} is one of the 19 parties running validators in the Guardian Network contributing to the VAA multisig.

## Guardian Network

Validators in their own P2P network who serve as Wormhole's oracle by observing activity on-chain and generating signed messages attesting to that activity.

## Guardian Set

The Guardian Set is a set of guardians responsible for validating a message emitted from the core contracts. Occasionally, the members of the set will change through a governance action.

## Heartbeat

Each Guardian will issue a `heartbeat` on a 15-second interval to signal that it is still running and convey details about its identity, uptime, version, and the status of the connected nodes.

You can view the heartbeats on the [Wormhole dashboard](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}.

## Observation

An Observation is a data structure describing a message emitted by the Core Contract and noticed by the Guardian node.

## Relayer

A relayer is any process that delivers VAAs to a destination.

## Sequence

A nonce, strictly increasing, which is tracked by the Wormhole Core Contract and unique to the emitter chain and address.

## Spy

A Spy is a daemon that eavesdrops on the messages passed between Guardians, typically to track VAAs as they get signed.

## VAA

[Verifiable Action Approvals](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} (VAAs) are the base data structure in the Wormhole ecosystem. They contain emitted messages along with information such as what contract emitted the message.

## Validator

A daemon configured to monitor a blockchain node and observe messages emitted by the Wormhole contracts.

title: MultiGov Architecture
description: Discover MultiGov's hub-and-spoke architecture, enabling secure cross-chain governance with Wormhole’s interoperability and decentralized coordination.
---

# MultiGov Architecture

MultiGov employs a hub-and-spoke model to enable cross-chain governance, utilizing Wormhole's interoperability infrastructure for secure cross-chain communication. This architecture allows coordinated decision-making across multiple blockchain networks while maintaining a central coordination point.

## Key Components

### Hub Chain Contracts

The hub chain is the central point for managing proposals, tallying votes, executing decisions, and coordinating governance across connected chains.

   - **`HubGovernor`** - central governance contract managing proposals and vote tallying
   - **`HubVotePool`** - receives aggregated votes from spokes and submits them to `HubGovernor`
   - **`HubMessageDispatcher`** - relays approved proposal executions to spoke chains
   - **`HubProposalExtender`** - allows trusted actors to extend voting periods if needed
   - **`HubProposalMetadata`** - helper contract returning `proposalId` and vote start for `HubGovernor` proposals
   - **`HubEvmSpokeAggregateProposer`** - aggregates cross-chain voting weight for an address and proposes via the `HubGovernor` if eligible

### Spoke Chains Contracts

Spoke chains handle local voting, forward votes to the hub, and execute approved proposals from the hub for decentralized governance.

   - **`SpokeVoteAggregator`** - collects votes on the spoke chain and forwards them to the hub
   - **`SpokeMessageExecutor`** - receives and executes approved proposals from the hub
   - **`SpokeMetadataCollector`** - fetches proposal metadata from the hub for spoke chain voters
   - **`SpokeAirlock`** - acts as governance's "admin" on the spoke, has permissions, and its treasury

### Spoke Solana Staking Program

The Spoke Solana Staking Program handles local voting from users who have staked W tokens or are vested in the program, forwards votes to the hub, and executes approved proposals from the hub for decentralized governance.

The program implements its functionality through instructions, using specialized PDA accounts where data is stored. Below are the key accounts in the program:

 - **`GlobalConfig`** - global program configuration
 - **`StakeAccountMetadata`** - stores user's staking information
 - **`CustodyAuthority`** - PDA account managing custody and overseeing token operations related to stake accounts
 - **`StakeAccountCustody`** - token account associated with a stake account for securely storing staked tokens
 - **`CheckpointData`** - tracks delegation history
 - **`SpokeMetadataCollector`** - collects and updates proposal metadata from the hub chain
 - **`GuardianSignatures`** - stores guardian signatures for message verification
 - **`ProposalData`** - stores data about a specific proposal, including votes and start time
 - **`ProposalVotersWeightCast`** - tracks individual voter's weight for a proposal
 - **`SpokeMessageExecutor`** - processes messages from a spoke chain via the Wormhole protocol
 - **`SpokeAirlock`** - manages PDA signing and seed validation for secure instruction execution
 - **`VestingBalance`** - stores total vesting balance and related staking information of a vester
 - **`VestingConfig`** - defines vesting configuration, including mint and admin details
 - **`Vesting`** - represents individual vesting allocations with maturation data
 - **`VoteWeightWindowLengths`** - tracks lengths of vote weight windows

Each account is implemented as a Solana PDA (Program Derived Address) and utilizes Anchor's account framework for serialization and management.

## System Workflow

The MultiGov system workflow details the step-by-step process for creating, voting on, and executing governance proposals across connected chains, from proposal creation to final cross-chain execution.

### EVM Governance Workflow

The EVM-based MultiGov workflow follows these steps:

1. **Proposal creation**:
    1. A user creates a proposal through the `HubEvmSpokeAggregateProposer`, which checks eligibility across chains, or directly on the `HubGovernor` via the `propose` method
    2. The proposal is submitted to the `HubGovernor` if the user meets the proposal threshold
2. **Proposal metadata distribution**:
    1. `HubProposalMetadata` creates a custom view method to be queried for use in the `SpokeMetadataCollector`
    2. `SpokeMetadataCollector` on each spoke chain queries `HubProposalMetadata` for proposal details
3. **Voting process**:
    1. Users on spoke chains vote through their respective `SpokeVoteAggregators`
    2. `SpokeVoteAggregators` send aggregated votes to the `HubVotePool` via Wormhole
    3. `HubVotePool` submits the aggregated votes to the `HubGovernor`
4. **Vote tallying and proposal execution**:
    1. `HubGovernor` tallies votes from all chains
    2. If a quorum is reached and there are more for votes than against votes, the vote passes and is queued for execution
    3. After the timelock delay, the proposal can be executed on the hub chain
    4. For cross-chain actions, a proposal should call the `dispatch` method in the `HubMessageDispatcher`, which sends execution messages to the relevant spoke chains
    5. `SpokeMessageExecutors` on each spoke chain receive and execute the approved actions through their respective `SpokeAirlocks`

### Solana Governance Workflow

The Solana-based MultiGov workflow follows these steps:

1. **Proposal creation**:
    1. A user creates a proposal on `HubGovernor` by calling the `propose` method, provided they meet the proposal threshold
    2. For the proposal to be executed on the Solana blockchain, a `SolanaPayload` must be generated and included in the `calldata` parameter of the `propose` function
    3. The `SolanaPayload` contains encoded details specifying which instructions will be executed and which Solana program is responsible for execution

2. **Proposal metadata distribution**:
    1. A user queries `getProposalMetadata` from `HubProposalMetadata` via the Wormhole query system to create a proposal on the **Spoke Solana Chain Staking Program**
    2. The retrieved metadata is used in the `AddProposal` instruction in the Solana program
    3. The proposal data is verified to ensure it matches the expected format
    4. Guardian signatures are posted using the `PostSignatures` instruction
    5. Once validated, the proposal is stored on-chain

3. **Voting process**:
    1. Users vote on proposals stored in the `ProposalData` account on Solana
    2. The `CastVote` instruction records their choice (`for_votes`, `against_votes`, or `abstain_votes`)
    3. Eligibility and vote weight are verified using historical voter checkpoint data
    4. A **Query Wormhole** request retrieves vote data from a Solana PDA
    5. The signed response from Wormhole guardians is submitted to the `HubVotePool` on Ethereum for verification
    6. The `crossChainVote` function in `HubVotePool` processes the validated response and forwards the aggregated vote data to the `HubGovernor` to finalize the decision

4. **Vote tallying and proposal execution**:
    1. `HubGovernor` tallies votes from all chains
    2. If a quorum is reached with more **for votes** than **against votes**, the proposal passes and is queued for execution
    3. After the timelock delay, the proposal can be executed either on the hub chain or another chain
    4. For cross-chain execution involving Solana, the proposal calls the `dispatch` method in `HubSolanaMessageDispatcher`, which sends execution messages to Solana
    5. On Solana, the `ReceiveMessage` instruction processes the approved message, and the `SpokeAirlock` executes the corresponding instructions

## Cross-Chain Communication

MultiGov relies on Wormhole's infrastructure for all cross-chain messaging, ensuring secure and reliable communication between chains. Wormhole's cross-chain state read system, known as Queries, is used for vote aggregation and proposal metadata. Additionally, cross-chain proposal execution messages are transmitted through Wormhole's custom relaying system, enabling seamless coordination across multiple blockchain networks.

## Security Measures

- **Vote weight window** - implements a moving window for vote weight checkpoints to mitigate cross-chain double voting
    - **Proposal extension** - `HubProposalExtender` allows for extending voting periods by a trusted actor in the case of network issues or high-stakes decisions
- **Timelock** - a timelock period between proposal approval and execution allows for additional security checks and community review
- **Wormhole verification** - all cross-chain messages are verified using Wormhole's secure messaging protocol

## Detailed Architecture Diagram

This architecture ensures that MultiGov can operate securely and efficiently across multiple chains, allowing for truly decentralized and cross-chain governance while maintaining a unified decision-making process.

# MultiGov: Cross-Chain Governance with Wormhole

## Overview

### What Is MultiGov and Why Is It Important?

MultiGov is a cross-chain governance system that extends traditional DAO governance across multiple blockchain networks. By leveraging Wormhole's interoperability infrastructure, MultiGov enables seamless voting and proposal mechanisms across various chains.

MultiGov is important because it:

- **Increases participation** by allowing token holders from multiple chains to engage in governance
- **Enhances security** by leveraging Wormhole's robust cross-chain communication
- **Improves scalability** by integrating any chain supported by Wormhole
- **Enables unified governance** and coordinated decision-making across multiple networks

### Key Features

- **Hub and spoke model** - central coordination on a hub chain with participation from multiple spoke chains. A hub chain is where the governance state lives, while the spoke chains can be considered extensions of governance that allow for participation by token holders on other chains
- **Cross-chain voting** - token holders on any integrated chain can cast votes
- **Vote aggregation** - votes from all chains are collected and tallied on the hub
- **Cross-chain proposal execution** - approved proposals can be executed across multiple chains
- **Wormhole integration** - secure and reliable cross-chain communication
- **Flexible architecture** - can integrate with any Wormhole-supported blockchain

### High-Level Architecture Diagram

The diagram below represents MultiGov's high-level architecture, focusing on its hub-and-spoke model for decentralized governance across multiple chains. The hub chain acts as the central governance controller, managing proposal creation, vote tallying, and execution, while the spoke chains handle local voting and proposal execution on individual chains. The hub and spoke chains communicate via Wormhole's cross-chain messaging infrastructure, ensuring secure and efficient governance across multiple blockchain networks.

# Architecture

## Overview

Wormhole has several noteworthy components. Before discussing each component in depth, this page will provide an overview of how the major pieces fit together.

![Wormhole architecture detailed diagram: source to target chain communication.](/docs/images/learn/infrastructure/architecture/architecture-1.webp)

The preceding diagram outlines the end-to-end flow of multichain communication through Wormhole's architecture, which is described as follows:

1. **Source chain** - a source contract emits a message by interacting with the [Wormhole Core Contract](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} on the source chain, which publishes the message in the blockchain's transaction logs
2. **Guardian Network** - [Guardians](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} validate these messages and sign them to produce [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}
3. **Relayers** - off-chain relayers or applications fetch the VAA and relay it to the target chain
4. **Target chain** - on the target chain, the message is consumed by the appropriate contract. This contract interacts with the Wormhole Core Contract to verify the VAA and execute the intended multichain operation. 

    The flow from the relayer to the target chain involves an entry point contract, which could vary based on the use case:

    - In some applications, the target contract acts as the entry point and performs verification via the Core Contract
    - In products like the Token Bridge, the Token Bridge contract itself interacts with the Core Contract

## On-Chain Components

- **Emitter** - a contract that calls the publish message method on the Core Contract. To identify the message, the Core Contract will write an event to the transaction logs with details about the emitter and sequence number. This may be your [xDapp](/docs/learn/glossary/#xdapp){target=\_blank} or an existing ecosystem protocol
- **[Wormhole Core Contract](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank}** - primary contract, this is the contract which the Guardians observe and which fundamentally allows for multichain communication
- **Transaction logs** - blockchain-specific logs that allow the Guardians to observe messages emitted by the Core Contract

## Off-Chain Components

- **Guardian Network** - validators that exist in their own P2P network. Guardians observe and validate the messages emitted by the Core Contract on each supported chain to produce VAAs (signed messages)
- **[Guardian](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank}** - one of 19 validators in the Guardian Network that contributes to the VAA multisig
- **[Spy](/docs/learn/infrastructure/spy/){target=\_blank}** - a daemon that subscribes to messages published within the Guardian Network. A Spy can observe and forward network traffic, which helps scale up VAA distribution
- **[API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}** - a REST server to retrieve details for a VAA or the Guardian Network
- **[VAAs](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}** - Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs) are the signed attestation of an observed message from the Wormhole Core Contract
- **[Relayer](/docs/learn/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank}** - any off-chain process that relays a VAA to the target chain
    - **Wormhole relayers** - a decentralized relayer network that delivers messages that are requested on-chain via the Wormhole relayer contract
    - **Custom relayers** - relayers that only handle VAAs for a specific protocol or multichain application. They can execute custom logic off-chain, reducing gas costs and increasing multichain compatibility. Currently, multichain application developers are responsible for developing and hosting custom relayers

# Core Contracts

## Introduction

The Wormhole Core Contract is a fundamental component of the Wormhole interoperability protocol deployed across each supported blockchain network. This contract acts as the foundational layer that enables secure and efficient cross-chain messaging, as all cross-chain applications either interact directly with the Core Contract or with another contract that does.

This guide summarizes the key functions of the Core Contract and outlines how the Core Contract works.

## Key Functions of the Wormhole Core Contract

- **Cross-chain messaging** - the Core Contract enables the transfer of messages between different blockchain networks connected via Wormhole. It standardizes and secures the message format, ensuring consistent communication across multiple chains. This capability allows developers to build cross-chain applications that leverage the unique features of each network

- **Verification and validation** - the Core Contract is responsible for verifying and validating all VAAs received on the target chain. When a message is transmitted from one blockchain, it is signed by the Wormhole Guardians (a decentralized set of validators). The Core Contract on the target chain checks this signature to confirm that the message is legitimate and has not been tampered with

- **Guardian Network coordination** - the Core Contract coordinates with Wormhole's Guardian Network to facilitate secure, trustless communication across chains. By relying on a quorum of Guardians to verify cross-chain messages and transactions, the contract ensures that only validated interactions are processed, enhancing the protocol's overall security and reliability

- **Event emission for monitoring** - the Core Contract emits events for every cross-chain message it processes, allowing dApps and developers to monitor activity on the network. These events are critical for tracking message statuses, debugging, and building responsive applications that can react to cross-chain events in real time

## How the Core Contract Works

The Wormhole Core Contract is central in facilitating secure and efficient cross-chain transactions. It enables communication between different blockchain networks by packaging transaction data into standardized messages, verifying their authenticity, and ensuring they are executed correctly on the destination chain. This process involves several steps, from the initial message submission to final execution, all while leveraging the Wormhole Guardian network to maintain trust and security.

Below is a simplified breakdown that focuses on the role of the Wormhole Core Contract in these operations:

1. **Message submission** - when a user initiates a cross-chain transaction, the Wormhole Core Contract on the source chain packages the transaction data into a standardized message payload and submits it to the Guardian Network for verification
2. **Guardian verification** - the Guardians observe and sign the message independently. Once enough Guardians have signed the message, the collection of signatures is combined with the message and metadata to produce a VAA
3. **Message reception and execution** - on the target chain, the Wormhole Core Contract receives the verified message, checks the Guardians' signatures, and executes the corresponding actions, such as minting tokens, updating states, or calling specific smart contract functions

For a closer look at how messages flow between chains and all of the components involved, you can refer to the [Architecture Overview](/docs/learn/infrastructure/architecture/) page.

### Message Submission

When sending a cross-chain message from the source chain Core Contract, you'll call a function that publishes the message. The implementation strategy for publishing messages differs by chain. However, the general strategy consists of the Core Contract posting the following items to the blockchain logs:

- `emitterAddress` - the contract which made the call to publish the message
- `sequenceNumber` - a unique number that increments for every message for a given emitter (and implicitly chain)
- `consistencyLevel`- the level of finality to reach before the Guardians will observe and attest the emitted event. This is a defense against reorgs and rollbacks since a transaction, once considered "final,"  is guaranteed not to have the state changes it caused rolled back. Since different chains use different consensus mechanisms, each one has different finality assumptions, so this value is treated differently on a chain-by-chain basis. See the options for finality for each chain in the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} reference page

There are no fees to publish a message except when publishing on Solana, but this is subject to change in the future.

### Message Reception

When receiving a cross-chain message on the target chain Core Contract, the general approach involves parsing and verifying the [components of a VAA](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas#vaa-format).

The process of receiving and verifying a VAA ensures that the message was properly attested by the Guardian Network, maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the data transmitted between chains.

## Multicast

Multicast refers to simultaneously broadcasting a single message or transaction across different blockchains. This means there is no destination address or chain for the sending and receiving functions. This is possible because VAAs attest that "this contract on this chain said this thing." Therefore, VAAs are multicast by default and will be verified as authentic on any chain where they are used.

This multicast-by-default model makes it easy to synchronize the state across the entire ecosystem because a single blockchain can make its data available to every chain in a single action with low latency. This reduces the complexity of the n^2 problems encountered by routing data to a large number of blockchains.

This doesn't mean an application _cannot_ specify a destination address or chain. For example, the Token Bridge and Wormhole relayer contracts require that some destination details be passed and verified on the destination chain.

Because the VAA creation is separate from relaying, the multicast model does not incur an additional cost when a single chain is targeted. If the data isn't needed on a certain blockchain, don't relay it there, and it won't cost anything.

title: Guardians
description: Explore Wormhole's Guardian Network, a decentralized system for secure, scalable cross-chain communication across various blockchain ecosystems.

## Guardian

Wormhole relies on a set of distributed nodes that monitor the state on several blockchains. In Wormhole, these nodes are referred to as Guardians. The current Guardian set can be seen in the [Dashboard](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}.

It is the Guardians' role to observe messages and sign the corresponding payloads. Each Guardian performs this step in isolation, combining the resulting signatures with other Guardians as a final step. The resulting collection of independent observations forms a multisig, representing proof that the majority of the Wormhole network has observed and agreed upon a state. These multisigs are referred to as VAAs in Wormhole.

## Guardian Network

The Guardian Network is designed to serve as Wormhole's oracle component, and the entire Wormhole ecosystem is founded on its technical underpinnings. It is the most critical element of the Wormhole ecosystem and represents the most crucial component to learn about if you want a deep understanding of it.

To understand not just _how_ the Guardian Network works but _why_ it works the way it does, it is important to review the key design considerations. To become the best-in-class interoperability platform, Wormhole needed to have five critical features:

- **Decentralization** - control of the network needs to be distributed amongst many parties
- **Modularity** - disparate parts of the ecosystem, such as the oracle, relayer, applications, and others, should be kept as separate and modular as possible so they can be designed, modified, and upgraded independently
- **Chain Agnosticism** - Wormhole should be able to support not only EVM but also chains like Solana, Algorand, Cosmos, and even platforms that still need to be created. It also shouldn't have any one chain as a single point of failure
- **Scalability** - Wormhole should be able to secure a large amount of value immediately and be able to handle the large transaction volume
- **Upgradeable** - as the decentralized computing ecosystem evolves, Wormhole will need to be able to change the implementation of its existing modules without breaking integrators

Next, the ways by which Wormhole achieves this will be examined individually.

### Decentralization

Decentralization is the biggest concern. Previous interoperability solutions have largely been entirely centralized, and even newer solutions utilizing things like adversarial relayers still tend to have single points of failure or collusion thresholds as low as one or two.

When designing a decentralized oracle network, the first option to consider is likely a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system however, this is a suboptimal solution. PoS is designed for blockchain consensus in smart contract-enabled environments, so it's less suitable when the network verifies the output of many blockchains and doesn't support its own smart contracts. While it looks appealing from a decentralization perspective, network security remains to be seen, and it can make some of the other outlined goals more challenging to achieve. Different options need to be explored.

Another option is to use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to secure the network. This would be a good solution from a decentralization perspective, as it's trustless. However, ZKPs are still a nascent technology, and verifying them on-chain isn't feasible, especially on chains with limited computational environments. That means a form of multisig will be needed to secure the network.

In the current De-Fi landscape, most of the top blockchains are secured by the same handful of validator companies. Currently, only a limited number of companies in the world have the skills and capital to run top-notch validator companies.

If a protocol could unite a large number of those validator companies into a purpose-built consensus mechanism optimized for chain interoperability, that design would likely be more performant and secure than a network bootstrapped by a tokenomics model. Assuming the validators would be on board, how many could Wormhole realistically utilize?

If Wormhole used threshold signatures, the answer would be "as many as are willing to participate." However, threshold signatures need more support across the blockchain world, meaning verifying the signatures would be difficult and expensive, ultimately limiting scalability and chain agnosticism. Thus, a t-schnorr multisig presents itself as the best option: cheap and well-supported, even though its verification costs increase linearly with the number of signatures included.

All these things considered, 19 seems to be the maximum number and a good tradeoff. If two-thirds of the signatures are needed for consensus, then 13 signatures must be verified on-chain, which remains reasonable from a gas-cost perspective.

Rather than securing the network with tokenomics, it is better to initially secure the network by involving robust companies that are heavily invested in De-Fi's success. The 19 Guardians aren't anonymous or small, they are many of the largest and most widely known validator companies in cryptocurrency. 

This led to a network of 19 Guardians, each with an equal stake, and joined in a purpose-built Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism. As threshold signatures become better supported, the Guardian Set can expand, and once ZKPs are ubiquitous, the Guardian Network will become fully trustless.

With the perspective on Decentralization laid out, the remaining elements fall into place.

### Modularity

The Guardian Network is robust and trustworthy by itself, so there's no need for components like the relayer to contribute to the security model. That makes Wormhole able to have simple components that are very good at their one thing. Guardians only need to verify on-chain activity and produce VAAs, while relayers only need to interact with blockchains and deliver messages.

The VAAs' signing scheme can be changed without affecting downstream users, and multiple relay mechanisms can exist independently. xAssets can be implemented purely at the application layer, and cross-chain applications can use whatever components suit them.

### Chain Agnosticism

Today, Wormhole supports a broader range of ecosystems than any other interoperability protocol because it uses simple tech (t-schnorr signatures), an adaptable, heterogeneous relayer model, and a robust validator network.

Wormhole can expand to new ecosystems as quickly as a Core Contract can be developed for the smart contract runtime. Relayers don't need to be factored into the security model; they just need to be able to upload messages to the blockchain. The Guardians are able to observe every transaction on every chain without taking shortcuts.

### Scalability

Wormhole scales well, as demonstrated by its ability to handle huge total value locked (TVL) and transaction volume even during tumultuous events.

The requirements for running a Guardian are relatively heavy, as they must run a full node for every single blockchain in the ecosystem. This is another reason why a limited number of robust validator companies are beneficial for this design.

However, once all the full nodes are running, the Guardian Network's actual computation and network overheads become lightweight. The blockchains' performance tends to be the bottleneck in Wormhole rather than anything happening inside the Guardian Network.

### Upgradeable

Over time, the Guardian Set can be expanded beyond 19 using threshold signatures. Various relaying models will emerge, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. ZKPs can be used on chains where they are well-supported. The cross-chain application ecosystem will grow, and cross-chain applications will become increasingly intermingled. There are very few APIs in Wormhole, and most items are implementation details from the integrator perspective. This creates a clear pathway towards a fully trustless interoperability layer that spans decentralized computing.

# Relayers

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to relayers within the Wormhole network, describing their role, types, and benefits in facilitating cross-chain processes.

Relayers in the Wormhole context are processes that deliver [Verified Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} to their destination, playing a crucial role in Wormhole's security model. They can't compromise security, only availability, and act as delivery mechanisms for VAAs without the capacity to tamper with the outcome.

There are three primary types of relayers discussed:

- **Client-side relaying** - a cost-efficient, no-backend-infrastructure approach relying on user-facing front ends. It provides a simple solution, although it can complicate the user experience due to the manual steps involved
- **Custom relayers** - backend components that handle parts of the cross-chain process, offering a smoother user experience and allowing off-chain calculations to reduce gas costs. These relayers could operate through direct listening to the Guardian Network (Spy relaying)
- **Wormhole-deployed relayers** - a decentralized relayer network that can deliver arbitrary VAAs, reducing the developer's need to develop, host, or maintain relayers. However, they require all calculations to be done on-chain and might be less gas-efficient

## Fundamentals

This section highlights the crucial principles underpinning the operation and handling of relayers within the Wormhole network.

Relayers are fundamentally trustless entities within the network. This means that while they don't require your trust, they shouldn't be trusted implicitly. They function as delivery mechanisms, transporting VAAs from their source to their destination.

Key characteristics of VAAs include:

- Public emission from the Guardian Network
- Authentication through signatures from the Guardian Network
- Verifiability by any entity or any Wormhole Core Contract
- As a result of these characteristics, anyone can pick up a VAA and deliver it anywhere, but no one can alter the VAA content without invalidating the signatures

When designing contracts, it's crucial to only trust information contained within your contract or a VAA. Relying on information from a relayer could expose you to input attacks.

Advanced strategies can involve relayers performing trustless off-chain computation passed into the destination contract. These strategies can optimize gas costs but also create attack vectors if not used correctly.

In summary, the design of a relayer should ensure that there's a single, deterministic way to process messages in your protocol. In an optimally designed protocol, relayers should have a "correct" implementation, mirroring "crank turner" processes used elsewhere in blockchain.

## Client-Side Relaying

Client-side relaying relies on user-facing front ends, such as a webpage or a wallet, to complete the cross-chain process.

**Key Features**

- **Cost-efficiency** - users only pay the transaction fee for the second transaction, eliminating any additional costs
- **No backend infrastructure** - the process is completely client-based, eliminating the need for a backend relaying infrastructure

**Implementation**

Users themselves carry out the three steps of the cross-chain process:

1. Perform an action on chain A
2. Retrieve the resulting VAA from the Guardian Network
3. Perform an action on chain B using the VAA

**Considerations**

!!! note
    Though simple, this type of relaying is generally not recommended if your aim is a highly polished user experience. It can, however, be useful for getting a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) up and running.

- Users must sign all required transactions with their own wallet
- Users must have funds to pay the transaction fees on every chain involved
- The user experience may be cumbersome due to the manual steps involved

## Custom Relayers

Custom relayers are purpose-built components within the Wormhole protocol, designed to relay messages for specific applications. They are capable of performing off-chain computations and can be customized to suit a variety of use cases.

The main method of setting up a custom relayer is by listening directly to the Guardian Network via a [Spy](/docs/learn/infrastructure/spy/).

**Key Features**

- **Optimization** - capable of performing trustless off-chain computations which can optimize gas costs
- **Customizability** - allows for specific strategies like batching, conditional delivery, multi-chain deliveries, and more
- **Incentive structure** - developers have the freedom to design an incentive structure suitable for their application
- **Enhanced UX** - the ability to retrieve a VAA from the Guardian Network and perform an action on the target chain using the VAA on behalf of the user can simplify the user experience

**Implementation**

!!! note
    To make the development of custom relayers easier, a plugin relayer is available in the [main Wormhole repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/relayer){target=\_blank}. This sets up the basic infrastructure for relaying, allowing developers to focus on implementing the specific logic for their application.

**Considerations**

Remember, despite their name, custom relayers still need to be considered trustless. VAAs are public and can be submitted by anyone, so developers shouldn't rely on off-chain relayers to perform any computation considered "trusted."

- Development work and hosting of relayers are required
- The fee-modeling can become complex, as relayers are responsible for paying target chain fees
- Relayers are responsible for availability, adding dependency for the cross-chain application

## Wormhole Relayers

Wormhole relayers are a component of a decentralized network in the Wormhole protocol, facilitating the delivery of VAAs to recipient contracts compatible with the standard relayer API.

**Key Features**

- **Lower operational costs** - no need to develop, host, or maintain individual relayers
- **Simplified integration** - because there is no need to run a relayer, integration is as simple as calling a function and implementing an interface

**Implementation**

The Wormhole relayer integration involves two key steps:

- **Delivery request** - request delivery from the ecosystem Wormhole relayer contract
- **Relay reception** - implement a [`receiveWormholeMessages`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/bacbe82e6ae3f7f5ec7cdcd7d480f1e528471bbb/src/interfaces/IWormholeReceiver.sol#L44-L50){target=\_blank} function within their contracts. This function is invoked upon successful relay of the VAA

**Considerations**

!!! note
    Developers should note that the choice of relayers depends their project's specific requirements and constraints. Wormhole relayers offer simplicity and convenience but limit customization and optimization opportunities compared to custom relayers.

- All computations are performed on-chain
- Potentially less gas-efficient compared to custom relayers
- Optimization features like conditional delivery, batching, off-chain calculations might be restricted
- Support may not be available for all chains

description: Discover Wormhole's Spy daemon, which subscribes to gossiped messages in the Guardian Network, including VAAs and Observations, with setup instructions.

# Spy

## Introduction

In Wormhole’s ecosystem, the _Spy_ is a daemon, a continuously running background process that monitors messages within the Guardian Network. Unlike Guardians, Spies don’t perform validation; instead, they serve as an interface for observing the network’s message traffic, enabling applications and users to access live data transmitted over Wormhole.

The primary purpose of a Spy is to subscribe to the gossiped messages across the Guardian Network, tracking key message types that allow integrators and applications to monitor real-time network activity without directly engaging in consensus operations.

## Key Features of the Spy

### Monitor Spy-Accessible Messages

Spies can access the following categories of messages shared over the gossip protocol::

- [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} - packets of cross-chain data. The Spy can detect whether a VAA has been approved by the Guardian Network, making it a valuable tool for applications needing real-time cross-chain verification
- [Observations](/docs/learn/glossary/#observation){target=\_blank} - emitted by Wormhole’s core contracts, observations are picked up by the Guardians and relayed across the network. Spies allow users to monitor these messages, adding transparency and insight into blockchain events
- [Guardian heartbeats](/docs/learn/glossary/#heartbeat){target=\_blank} - heartbeat messages represent Guardian node statusn. By monitoring heartbeats, a Spy can signal the liveness and connectivity of Guardians in the network

## Integrator Use Case

The Spy provides a valuable mechanism for integrators to observe real-time network activity in the Guardian Network without directly engaging in validation or consensus. By running a Spy, integrators can track cross-chain events, and message flows — such as VAAs, observations, and Guardian heartbeats — to monitor network activity essential to their applications.

This monitoring capability is especially beneficial for applications that need immediate insights into cross-chain data events. Integrators can run a Spy to ensure their applications are promptly informed of message approvals, observations, or Guardian liveness signals, supporting timely and responsive app behavior without additional overhead on network resources.

## Resources

For more information, you can check out the following resources:

- The source code for the Go implementation of the Spy is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/node/cmd/spy/spy.go){target=\_blank}
- To find out how to [start and run a Spy](/docs/infrastructure/spy/run-spy/){target=\_blank}, refer to the infrastructure section. This setup enables integrators to create a custom endpoint that applications can use to observe message flows in the Guardian Network, providing greater flexibility and control over cross-chain monitoring

title: VAAs
description: Learn about Verified Action Approvals (VAAs) in Wormhole, their structure, validation, and role in cross-chain communication.
---

# Verified Action Approvals

VAAs are Wormhole's core messaging primitive. They are packets of cross-chain data emitted whenever a cross-chain application contract interacts with the Core Contract.

The Guardians must validate messages emitted by contracts before sending them to the target chain. Once a majority of Guardians observe the message and determine finality, the Guardians sign a keccak256 hash of the message body.

The message is wrapped up in a structure called a VAA, which combines the message with the Guardian signatures to form a proof.

VAAs are uniquely indexed by the (`emitter_chain`, `emitter_address`, `sequence`) tuple. To obtain a VAA, one can query the [Wormholescan API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank} with this information.

!!!note
    The `sequence` field depends on the final ordering of blocks on the emitter chain. When a lower consistency level is chosen (i.e., not waiting for finality), there is a chance that chain reorganizations could lead to multiple, different VAAs appearing for what looks like the “same” message on the user side. The tuple (`emitter_chain`, `emitter_address`, `sequence`) can only be considered unique if the chain does not undergo a reorg and the block containing the message has effectively reached finality. However, there is always a small chance of an extended reorg that could invalidate or alter a previously emitted sequence number.

These VAAs are ultimately what a smart contract on a receiving chain must process to receive a Wormhole message.

## VAA Format

The basic VAA has two components: a header and a body.

### Header

The header holds metadata about the current VAA, the Guardian set that is currently active, and the list of signatures gathered so far.

- `version` ++"byte"++ - the VAA Version
- `guardian_set_index` ++"u32"++ - indicates which Guardian set is signing
- `len_signatures` ++"u8"++ - the number of signatures stored
- `signatures` ++"[]signature"++ - the collection of Guardian signatures

Where each `signature` is:

- `index` ++"u8"++ - the index of this Guardian in the Guardian set
- `signature` ++"[65]byte"++ - the ECDSA signature

### Body

The body is _deterministically_ derived from an on-chain message. Any two Guardians processing the same message must derive the same resulting body. This requirement exists so that there is always a one-to-one relationship between VAAs and messages to avoid double-processing messages.

!!!note
    While the body is derived from the on-chain message, this is only strictly true once the chain's state is finalized (i.e., no further reorgs). If a reorg occurs and a transaction that previously appeared in block X is replaced by block Y, Guardians observing different forks may generate different VAAs for what the emitter contract believes is the “same” message.
    
    This scenario is less likely once a block is sufficiently buried, but it can still happen if you choose a faster (less finalized) consistency level.

- `timestamp` ++"u32"++ - the timestamp of the block this message was published in
- `nonce` ++"u32"++
- `emitter_chain` ++"u16"++ - the id of the chain that emitted the message
- `emitter_address` ++"[32]byte"++ - the contract address (Wormhole formatted) that called the Core Contract
- `sequence` ++"u64"++ - the auto-incrementing integer that represents the number of messages published by this emitter
- `consistency_level` ++"u8"++ - the [consistency (finality) level](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank}, required by this emitter
- `payload` ++"[]byte"++ - arbitrary bytes containing the data to be acted on

The body contains relevant information for entities, such as contracts, or other systems, that process or utilize VAAs. When a function like `parseAndVerifyVAA` is called, the body is returned, allowing verification of the `emitterAddress` to determine if the VAA originated from a trusted contract.

!!! note
    Because VAAs have no destination, they are effectively multicast. Any Core Contract on any chain in the network will verify them as authentic. If a VAA has a specific destination, relayers are entirely responsible for completing that delivery appropriately.

## Consistency and Finality

The [consistency (finality) level](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank}, determines whether Guardians wait for a chain’s final commitment state or issue a VAA sooner under less-final conditions. This choice is especially relevant for blockchains without instant finality, where the risk of reorganization remains until a block is deeply confirmed. 

Guardian watchers are specialized processes that monitor each blockchain in real time. They enforce the selected consistency level by deciding whether enough commitment has been reached before signing and emitting a VAA. Some chains allow only one commitment level (effectively final), while others let integrators pick between near-final or fully finalized states. Choosing a faster option speeds up VAA production but increases reorg risk; choosing a more conservative option takes longer but reduces the likelihood of rollback.

## Signatures

The body of the VAA is hashed twice with `keccak256` to produce the signed digest message.

```js
// hash the bytes of the body twice
digest = keccak256(keccak256(body))
// sign the result 
signature = ecdsa_sign(digest, key)
```

!!! note
    Different implementations of the ECDSA signature validation may apply a keccak256 hash to the message passed, so care must be taken to pass the correct arguments.
    
    For example, the [Solana secp256k1 program](https://docs.solanalabs.com/runtime/programs#secp256k1-program){target=\_blank} will hash the message passed. In this case, the argument for the message should be a single hash of the body, not the twice-hashed body.

## Payload Types

Different applications built on Wormhole may specify a format for the payloads attached to a VAA. This payload provides information on the target chain and contract so it can take action (e.g., minting tokens to a receiver address).

### Token Transfer

Tokens are transferred between chains using a lockup/mint and burn/unlock mechanism. Many bridges use such a basic method, but the implementation described leverages the generic message-passing protocol provided by Wormhole to handle the routing of lock and burn events across chains. This approach ensures that Wormhole's Token Bridge is chain-agnostic. The bridge can be rapidly integrated into any network with a Wormhole contract. Wormhole's generic message-passing doesn't require any program to send messages to understand the specific implementation details of other chains.

To transfer tokens from Chain A to Chain B, you must lock them on A and mint them on B. The tokens on A must be proven to be locked before the minting can occur on B. To facilitate this process, Chain A first locks the tokens and emits a message indicating that the locking has been completed. This message has the following structure and is referred to as a transfer message:

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ - the ID of the payload. This should be set to `1` for a token transfer
- `amount` ++"u256"++ - amount of tokens being transferred
- `token_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the source chain
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the source chain
- `to` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the destination chain
- `to_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the destination chain
- `fee` ++"u256"++ - portion of amount paid to a relayer

This structure contains everything the receiving chain needs to learn about a lockup event. Once Chain B receives this payload, it can mint the corresponding asset.

Note that Chain B is agnostic regarding how the tokens on the sending side were locked. They could have been burned by a mint or locked in a custody account. The protocol relays the event once enough Guardians have attested to its existence.

### Attestation

The Transfer event in the preceding section needs an important detail added. While the program on Chain B can trust the message to inform it of token lockup events, it has no way of verifying the correct token is locked up. The address alone is a meaningless value to most users. To solve this, the Token Bridge supports token attestation.

For a token attestation, Chain A emits a message containing metadata about a token, which Chain B may use to preserve the name, symbol, and decimal precision of a token address.

The message format for this action is as follows:

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ - the ID of the payload. This should be set to `2` for an attestation
- `token_address` ++"[32]byte"++ - address of the originating token contract
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - chain ID of the originating token 
- `decimals` ++"u8"++ - number of decimals this token should have
- `symbol` ++"[32]byte"++ - short name of asset
- `name` ++"[32]byte"++ - full name of asset

Attestations use a fixed-length byte array to encode UTF8 token name and symbol data.

!!! note
    Because the byte array is fixed length, the data contained may truncate multibyte Unicode characters.

When sending an attestation VAA, it is recommended to send the longest UTF-8 prefix that doesn't truncate a character and then right-pad it with zero bytes.

When parsing an attestation VAA, it is recommended to trim all trailing zero bytes and converting the remainder to UTF-8 via any lossy algorithm.

!!! note
    Be mindful that different on-chain systems may have different VAA parsers, resulting in different names/symbols on different chains if the string is long or contains invalid UTF8.

Without knowing a token's decimal precision, Chain B cannot correctly mint the number of tokens when processing a transfer. For this reason, the Token Bridge requires an attestation for each token transfer.

### Token Transfer with Message

!!! note
    This VAA type is also referred to as a payload3 message or a Contract Controlled Transfer.

The Token Transfer with Message data structure is identical to the token-only data structure, except for the `fee` field, which is replaced with the `from_address` field, and the addition of a `payload` field containing arbitrary bytes. In this arbitrary byte field, an app may include additional data in the transfer to inform some application-specific behavior.

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ -  the ID of the payload. This should be set to `3` for a token transfer with message 
- `amount` ++"u256"++ - amount of tokens being transferred
- `token_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the source chain
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the source chain
- `to` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the destination chain
- `to_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the destination chain
- `from_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address that called the Token Bridge on the source chain
- `payload` ++"[]byte"++ - message, arbitrary bytes, app specific

### Governance

Governance VAAs don't have a `payload_id` field like the preceding formats. They're used to trigger some action in the deployed contracts (for example, upgrade).

### Action Structure

Governance messages contain pre-defined actions, which can target the various Wormhole modules currently deployed on-chain. The structure contains the following fields:

- `module` ++"u8[32]"++ - contains a right-aligned module identifier
- `action` ++"u8"++ - predefined governance action to execute
- `chain`  ++"u16"++ - chain the action is targeting. This should be set to `0` for all chains
- `args`  ++"any"++ - arguments to the action

Below is an example message containing a governance action triggering a code upgrade to the Solana Core Contract. The module field here is a right-aligned encoding of the ASCII Core, represented as a 32-byte hex string.

```js
module:       0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000436f7265
action:       1
chain:        1
new_contract: 0x348567293758957162374959376192374884562522281937446234828323
```

### Actions

The meaning of each numeric action is pre-defined and documented in the Wormhole design documents. For each application, the relevant definitions can be found via these links:

- [Core governance actions](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0002_governance_messaging.md){target=\_blank}
- [Token Bridge governance actions](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0003_token_bridge.md){target=\_blank}

## Lifetime of a Message

!!! note
    Anyone can submit the VAA to the target chain. The Guardians typically don't perform this step to avoid transaction fees. Instead, applications built on top of Wormhole can acquire the VAA via the Guardian RPC and make the submission in a separate flow.

With the concepts now defined, it is possible to illustrate what a full flow for message passing between two chains looks like. The following stages demonstrate each step of processing that the Wormhole network performs to route a message.

1. **A message is emitted by a contract running on Chain A** - any contract can emit messages, and the Guardians are programmed to observe all chains for these events. Here, the Guardians are represented as a single entity to simplify the graphics, but the observation of the message must be performed individually by each of the 19 Guardians
2. **Signatures are aggregated** - Guardians observe and sign the message independently. Once enough Guardians have signed the message, the collection of signatures is combined with the message and metadata to produce a VAA
3. **VAA submitted to target chain** - the VAA acts as proof that the Guardians have collectively attested the existence of the message payload; to complete the final step, the VAA itself is submitted (or relayed) to the target chain to be processed by a receiving contract

# Introduction to Wormhole

In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, interoperability between different blockchains remains a significant challenge. Developers often face hurdles in creating applications that can seamlessly operate across multiple blockchains, limiting innovation and the potential of decentralized ecosystems.

Wormhole addresses this problem by providing a _generic message-passing_ protocol that enables secure and efficient communication between blockchains. By allowing data and asset transfers across various blockchain networks, Wormhole breaks down the walls that traditionally separate these ecosystems.

Wormhole is distinguished by its focus on robust security, scalability, and transparency. The protocol is supported by a decentralized network of validators that ensure the integrity of every cross-chain transaction. This, combined with Wormhole’s proven performance in real-world applications, gives developers a dependable platform to create and scale multichain applications confidently.

![Message-passing process in the Wormhole protocol](/docs/images/learn/introduction/introduction-1.webp)

!!! note
    The above is an oversimplified illustration of the protocol; details about the architecture and components are available on the [architecture page](/docs/learn/infrastructure/architecture/){target=\_blank}.

Wormhole allows developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchain ecosystems without being confined to one. This means applications can benefit from the unique features of various networks—such as Solana's high throughput, Ethereum's security, and Cosmos's interoperability while maintaining a unified, efficient user experience.

This page introduces the key concepts and components necessary to understand how Wormhole enables fast, secure, and scalable cross-chain communication.

## What Problems Does Wormhole Solve?

Interoperability is a critical challenge in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Individual blockchains are often isolated, limiting the potential for integrated applications operating across multiple ecosystems. Wormhole solves this problem by enabling seamless communication between blockchains, allowing developers to create multichain applications that can leverage the unique features of each network.

Critical problems Wormhole addresses include:

- **Blockchain isolation** - Wormhole connects disparate blockchains, enabling the transfer of assets, data, and governance actions across networks
- **Cross-chain complexity** - by abstracting the complexities of cross-chain communication, Wormhole makes it easier for developers to build and deploy cross-chain applications
- **Security and decentralization** - Wormhole prioritizes security through a decentralized Guardian network that validates and signs messages, ensuring the integrity of cross-chain interactions

## What Does Wormhole Offer?

Wormhole provides a suite of tools and protocols that support a wide range of use cases:

- **Cross-chain messaging** - securely transfer arbitrary data between blockchains, enabling the development of cross-chain decentralized applications (xDapps)
- **Asset transfers** - facilitate the movement of tokens and NFTs across supported chains with ease, powered by protocols built on Wormhole like [Portal](https://portalbridge.com/){target=\_blank}
- **Developer tools** - leverage [Wormhole’s SDKs](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/){target=\_blank}, [APIs](/docs/build/toolkit/#wormhole-api-docs){target=\_blank}, [Wormhole Scan](https://wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}, and documentation to build and deploy cross-chain applications quickly and efficiently

## What Isn't Wormhole?

- **Wormhole is _not_ a blockchain** - it acts as a communication layer that connects different blockchains, enabling them to interact without being a blockchain itself
- **Wormhole is _not_ a token bridge** - while it facilitates token transfers, Wormhole also supports a wide range of cross-chain applications, making it much more versatile than a typical bridge

## Use Cases of Wormhole

Consider the following examples of potential applications enabled by Wormhole:

- **Cross-chain exchange** - using [Wormhole Connect](/docs/build/transfers/connect/overview/){target=\_blank}, developers can build exchanges that allow deposits from any Wormhole-connected chain, significantly increasing liquidity access
- **[Cross-chain governance](https://wormhole.com/blog/stake-for-governance-is-now-live-for-w-token-holders){target=\_blank}** - NFT collections on different networks can use Wormhole to communicate votes cast on their respective chains to a designated "voting" chain for combined proposals
- **Cross-chain game** - games can be developed on a performant network like Solana, with rewards issued as NFTs on another network, such as Ethereum

# Security

## Core Security Assumptions

At its core, Wormhole is secured by a network of [Guardian](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} nodes that validate and sign messages. If a super majority (e.g., 13 out of 19) of Guardians sign the same message, it can be considered valid. A smart contract on the target chain will verify the signatures and format of the message before approving any transaction.

- Wormhole's core security primitive is its signed messages (signed [VAAs](/docs/learn/glossary/#vaa){target=\_blank})
- The Guardian network is currently secured by a collection of 19 of the world's top [validator companies](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}
- Guardians produce signed state attestations (signed VAAs) when requested by a Core Contract integrator
- Every Guardian runs full nodes (rather than light nodes) of every blockchain in the Wormhole network, so if a blockchain suffers a consensus attack or hard fork, the blockchain will disconnect from the network rather than potentially produce invalid signed VAAs
- Any Signed VAA can be verified as authentic by the Core Contract of any other chain
- [Relayers](/docs/learn/glossary/#relayer){target=\_blank} are considered untrusted in the Wormhole ecosystem

In summary:

- **Core integrators aren't exposed to risk from chains and contracts they don't integrate with**
- By default, you only trust Wormhole's signing process and the core contracts of the chains you're on
- You can expand your contract and chain dependencies as you see fit

Core assumptions aside, many other factors impact the real-world security of decentralized platforms. Here is more information on additional measures that have been put in place to ensure the security of Wormhole.

## Guardian Network

Wormhole is an evolving platform. While the Guardian set currently comprises 19 validators, this is a limitation of current blockchain technology.

### Governance

Governance is the process through which contract upgrades happen. Guardians manually vote on governance proposals that originate inside the Guardian Network and are then submitted to ecosystem contracts.

This means that governance actions are held to the same security standard as the rest of the system. A two-thirds supermajority of the Guardians is required to pass any governance action.

Governance messages can target any of the various wormhole modules, including the core contracts and all currently deployed token bridge contracts. When a Guardian signs such a message, its signature implies a vote on the action in question. Once more than two-thirds of the Guardians have signed, the message and governance action are considered valid.

All governance actions and contract upgrades have been managed via Wormhole's on-chain governance system.

Via governance, the Guardians can:

- Change the current Guardian set
- Expand the Guardian set
- Upgrade ecosystem contract implementations

The governance system is fully open source in the core repository. See the [Open Source section](#open-source){target=\_blank} for contract source.

## Monitoring

A key element of Wormhole's defense-in-depth strategy is that each Guardian is a highly competent validator company with its own in-house processes for running, monitoring, and securing blockchain operations. This heterogeneous approach to monitoring increases the likelihood that fraudulent activity is detected and reduces the number of single failure points in the system.

Guardians are not just running Wormhole validators; they're running validators for every blockchain inside of Wormhole as well, which allows them to perform monitoring holistically across decentralized computing rather than just at a few single points.

Guardians monitor:

- Block production and consensus of each blockchain - if a blockchain's consensus is violated, it will be disconnected from the network until the Guardians resolve the issue
- Smart contract level data - via processes like the Governor, Guardians constantly monitor the circulating supply and token movements across all supported blockchains
- Guardian level activity - the Guardian Network functions as an autonomous decentralized computing network, ensuring independent security measures across its validators

## Asset Layer Protections

One key strength of the Wormhole ecosystem is the Guardians’ ability to validate and protect the integrity of assets across multiple blockchains.

To enforce the Wormhole Asset Layer’s core protections, the Global Accountant tracks the total circulating supply of all Wormhole assets across all chains, preventing any blockchain from bridging assets that could violate the supply invariant.

In addition to the Global Accountant, Guardians may only sign transfers that do not violate the requirements of the Governor. The [Governor](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0007_governor.md){target=\_blank} tracks inflows and outflows of all blockchains and delays suspicious transfers that may indicate an exploit.

## Open Source

Wormhole builds in the open and is always open source.

description: Unlock fast USDC transfers with Wormhole's integration of Circle's CCTP, featuring automatic relaying via the Wormhole relayer and native gas solutions.

# Circle's CCTP Bridge

Wormhole Connect and the Wormhole TypeScript SDK support fast, cheap, native USDC bridging between all networks supported by Circle's [Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol){target=\_blank}. CCTP is Circle's native USDC cross-chain transfer attestation service.

While this protocol is wholly separate from Wormhole itself, Wormhole builds on top of CCTP and adds several valuable augmentations, making it more straightforward to use and more useful for end users. These features include:

- **Automated relaying** - eliminates the need for users to redeem USDC transfers themselves
- **Gas payment on the destination chain** - allows users to transfer USDC without needing to pay gas on the destination chain
- **Gas drop off** - enables users to convert a portion of USDC into the destination chain's gas token upon a successful transfer

    Wormhole supports all CCTP-supported chains but at the moment only a [handful of chains](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/supported-domains){target=\_blank} are supported by Circle.

You can use Wormhole's CCTP-powered USDC bridging by embedding the [Connect Widget](/docs/build/transfers/connect/overview/){target=\_blank} or by integrating the [TypeScript SDK](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/){target=\_blank} directly.

## Automatic Relaying

To complete a CCTP transfer, the [Circle Attestation](https://developers.circle.com/api-reference/stablecoins/common/get-attestation){target=\_blank} must be delivered to the destination chain.

This attestation delivery may be difficult or impossible in some contexts. For example, in a browser context, the user doesn't wish to wait for finality to deliver the attestation. To address this difficulty, the Wormhole CCTP relayer may be used either with the [Wormhole Connect Widget](/docs/build/transfers/connect/overview/){target=\_blank} or more directly with the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/){target=\_blank}.

The Wormhole CCTP Relayer charges a fee to deliver the attestation and complete the transfer.

|      Chain      |       Fee       |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|
|  Ethereum       |     1.0 USDC    |
| Everything else |     0.1 USDC    |

<!-- this is maybe the intended profit margin, but definitely not the total relaying cost, needs to be reviewed -->

## Native Gas Drop Off

Another advantage of using the automatic relaying feature is the opportunity to transfer some native gas to the receiver on the destination chain. This feature is referred to as _native gas drop off_.

The ability to perform native gas drop off addresses the common issue where a user may hold a balance of USDC but has no native gas to perform subsequent transactions.

<!-- 
!!! note
    Native gas drop off is limited to TODO

### NTT vs. Token Bridge

Understand the key differences between Native Token Transfers (NTT) and Token Bridge to determine which solution best fits your needs.

- Native Token Transfers (NTT) move tokens in their original form without wrapping them, ensuring compatibility with on-chain applications but requiring custom contracts on both the source and destination chains
- Token Bridge locks tokens on the source chain and mints wrapped versions on the destination chain. This method does not require changes to existing token contracts and supports additional message payloads for more complex use cases

### Settlement  

Settlement enables fast and efficient multichain transfers by optimizing liquidity without relying on traditional bridging methods. Unlike NTT, which moves native assets directly between chains, and Token Bridge, which locks tokens and mints wrapped versions, Settlement uses intent-based execution. Users specify the desired transfer outcome, and solvers compete to fulfill it most efficiently.

By leveraging a decentralized solver network, Settlement ensures efficient cross-chain liquidity without locking assets or requiring asset wrapping, providing a seamless and capital-efficient solution for multichain transactions.

title: Native Token Transfers Architecture
description: Explore Wormhole's Native Token Transfers architecture, which covers components, message flow, rate limiting, and custom transceivers.
---

## Introduction

The Native Token Transfers (NTT) architecture within the Wormhole ecosystem offers a robust framework for secure and efficient token transfers across multiple blockchains. This architecture relies on the manager and transceiver core components that work together to manage cross-chain communication and token operations complexities.

For the technical implementations of the functions, refer to the [Managers and Transceivers](/docs/build/transfers/native-token-transfers/managers-transceivers/){target=\_blank} page.

## System Components

The NTT framework is composed of managers, which oversee the transfer process, and transceivers, which handle cross-chain messaging, ensuring smooth and reliable token transfers.

### Managers

_Managers_ are responsible for handling the flow of token transfers between different blockchains and ensuring that tokens are locked or burned on the source chain before being minted or unlocked on the destination chain. The main tasks of managers include rate-limiting transactions, verifying message authenticity (message attestation), and managing the interaction between multiple transceivers, who are responsible for cross-chain communications.

Each manager is assigned to a specific token but can operate across multiple chains. Their key responsibility is to ensure that tokens are securely locked or burned on the source chain before being minted or unlocked on the destination chain. This provides the integrity of token transfers and prevents double-spending.

A manager is responsible for:

- **Handling token transfer flow** - upon a transfer request, `NttManager` either locks or burns tokens depending on the configuration, emits a `TransferSent` event, and ensures tokens can’t be accessed on the source chain before leasing them on the destination chain. This process safeguards against double-spending and maintains a secure transfer
- **Rate-limiting** - the `NttManager` contract includes rate-limiting functionality to prevent overloading the network or flooding the target chain. The `NttManager` applies rate limits to manage transfer flow and prevent network congestion. Limits apply to both outgoing and incoming transfers
    - **Outbound** - transfers exceeding the outbound limit are queued (if `shouldQueue` is true) or reverted
    - **Inbound** - similar limits apply on the destination chain, delaying transfers if capacity is exceeded

    Rate limit duration and queuing are customizable per chain, and events notify users when transfers hit the limit

- **Message authenticity verification** - the `NttManager` ensures transfer security by verifying message authenticity through multiple attestations from transceivers. For each transfer, a threshold number of attestation signatures must be gathered from transceivers. Once verified, `NttManager` releases tokens on the destination chain, ensuring only authenticated transfers are processed
- **Interaction with transceivers** - `NttManager` collaborates with transceivers, forwarding transfer messages between chains and handling message verification. Transceivers route messages with transfer details to the destination chain, coordinating with `NttManager` to verify that tokens are locked or burned before releasing them on the other side. Transceivers can be customized to work with different security protocols, adding flexibility

### Transceivers

_Transceivers_ facilitate cross-chain token transfers by ensuring the accurate transmission of messages between different blockchains. They work in conjunction with managers to route token transfers from the source chain to the recipient chain. Their primary function is to ensure that messages regarding the transfer process are delivered correctly, and that tokens are safely transferred across chains.

While transceivers operate closely with Wormhole's ecosystem, they can also be configured independently of Wormhole's core system, allowing for flexibility. This adaptability allows them to be integrated with various verification backends to accommodate different security needs or platform-specific requirements.

Transceivers are entrusted with several responsibilities:

- **Message transmission** - transceivers handle the routing of transfer messages between chains. When a transfer is initiated, the transceiver sends the message (including transfer details like recipient and amount) to the destination chain’s manager for verification and processing
- **Manager coordination** - transceivers work with managers to ensure tokens are locked or burned on the source chain before issuance on the destination chain, reinforcing the security of each transfer
- **Custom verification support** - transceivers can integrate with custom verification backends, allowing flexibility to adapt to different security protocols or chain requirements. This customization enables protocols to use different attestation standards as needed

How it works:

1. The transceiver receives instructions from the manager to send messages across chains
2. It quotes delivery fees, handles cross-chain message relaying, and verifies delivery to ensure tokens are safely transferred
3. For each message, the transceiver coordinates with managers, ensuring only authorized transfers are processed on the destination chain

#### Custom Transceivers

The NTT framework supports advanced features such as custom transceivers for specialized message verification, enhancing security and adaptability. The architecture includes detailed processes for initiating transfers, managing rate limits, and finalizing token operations, with specific instructions and events outlined for EVM-compatible chains and Solana.

NTT has the flexibility to support custom message verification in addition to Wormhole Guardian message verification. Custom verifiers are implemented as transceiver contracts and can be protocol-specific or provided by other third-party attesters. Protocols can also configure the threshold of attestations required to mark a token transfer as valid — for example, 2/2, 2/3, 3/5.

![Custom Attestation with NTT diagram](/docs/images/learn/transfers/native-token-transfers/architecture/architecture-2.webp)

The verifier performs checks based on predefined criteria and issues approval for transactions that meet these requirements. This approval is incorporated into the Wormhole message, ensuring that only transactions verified by both the Wormhole Guardian Network and the additional verifier are processed. The model includes an extra verifier in the bridging process, enhancing security and providing an added assurance of transaction integrity.

## Lifecycle of a Message

The lifecycle of a message in the Wormhole ecosystem for Native Token Transfers (NTT) involves multiple steps to ensure secure and accurate cross-chain token transfers. This lifecycle can vary depending on the blockchain being used, and the following explanations focus on the EVM and Solana implementations. The key stages include initiating the transfer, handling rate limits, sending and receiving messages, and finally, minting or unlocking tokens on the destination chain.

### Transfer

The process begins when a client initiates a transfer. For EVM, this is done using the `transfer` function, whereas in Solana, the client uses either the `transfer_lock` or `transfer_burn` instruction, depending on whether the program is in locking or burning mode. The client specifies the transfer amount, recipient chain ID, recipient address, and a flag (`should_queue` on both EVM and Solana) to decide whether the transfer should be queued if it hits the rate limit.

In both cases:

- If the source chain is in locking mode, the tokens are locked on the source chain to be unlocked on the destination chain
- If the source chain is in burning mode, the tokens are burned on the source chain, and new tokens are minted on the destination chain

Once initiated, an event (such as `TransferSent` on EVM or a corresponding log on Solana) is emitted to signal that the transfer process has started.

### Rate Limit

Both EVM and Solana implement rate-limiting for transfers to prevent abuse or network overload. Rate limits apply to both the source and destination chains. If transfers exceed the current capacity, depending on whether the `shouldQueue` flag is set to true, they can be queued.

- On EVM, the transfer is added to an outbound queue if it hits the rate limit, with a delay corresponding to the configured rate limit duration. If `shouldQueue` is set to false, the transfer is reverted with an error
- On Solana, the transfer is added to an **Outbox** via the `insert_into_outbox method`, and if the rate limit is hit, the transfer is queued with a `release_timestamp`. If `shouldQueue` is false, the transfer is reverted with a `TransferExceedsRateLimit` error

Both chains emit events or logs when transfers are rate-limited or queued.

### Send

After being forwarded to the Transceiver, the message is transmitted across the chain. Transceivers are responsible for delivering the message containing the token transfer details. Depending on the Transceiver's implementation, messages may be routed through different systems, such as Wormhole relayers or other custom relaying solutions. Once the message is transmitted, an event is emitted to signal successful transmission.

- In EVM, the message is sent using the `sendMessage` function, which handles the transmission based on the Transceiver's implementation. The Transceiver may use Wormhole relayers or custom relaying solutions to forward the message
- In Solana, the transfer message is placed in an Outbox and released via the `release_outbound` instruction. The Solana transceiver, such as the Wormhole Transceiver, may send the message using the `post_message` instruction, which Wormhole Guardians observe for verification

In both cases, an event or log (e.g., `SendTransceiverMessage` on EVM or a similar log on Solana) is emitted to signal that the message has been transmitted.

### Receive

Upon receiving the message on the destination chain, an off-chain relayer forwards the message to the destination Transceiver for verification. 

- In EVM, the message is received by the `NttManager` on the destination chain, which verifies the message's authenticity. Depending on the M of N threshold set for the attestation process, the message may require attestations from multiple transceivers
- In Solana, the message is received via the `receive_message` instruction in the Wormhole Transceiver program. The message is verified and stored in a `VerifiedTransceiverMessage` account, after which it is placed in an Inbox for further processing

In both chains, replay protection mechanisms ensure that a message cannot be executed more than once. Events or logs are emitted (e.g., `ReceivedMessage` on EVM or `ReceiveMessage` on Solana) to notify that the message has been successfully received.

### Mint or Unlock

Finally, after the message is verified and attested to, the tokens can be either minted (if they were burned on the source chain) or unlocked (if they were locked). The tokens are then transferred to the recipient on the destination chain, completing the cross-chain token transfer process. 

- On EVM, tokens are either minted (if burned on the source chain) or unlocked (if locked on the source chain). The `TransferRedeemed` event signals that the tokens have been successfully transferred
- On Solana, the tokens are unlocked or minted depending on whether the program is in locking or burning mode. The `release_inbound_unlock` or `release_inbound_mint` instruction is used to complete the transfer, and a corresponding log is produced

In both cases, once the tokens have been released, the transfer process is complete, and the recipient receives the tokens. Events are emitted to indicate that the transfer has been fully redeemed.

# Deployment Models

The Wormhole framework offers two deployment models, each catering to different token management needs: the hub-and-spoke model and the burn-and-mint model. These models provide flexible solutions for both existing token deployments and new projects looking to enable secure and seamless multichain token transfers.

## Hub-and-Spoke

The hub-and-spoke model involves locking tokens on a central hub chain and minting them on destination spoke chains. This model maintains the total supply on the hub chain and is backward-compatible with any existing token deployment.

This model is ideal for existing token deployments that don't want to alter existing token contracts. It maintains the canonical balance on a hub chain while allowing for secure native deployment to new blockchains.

- **Hub chain** - tokens are locked when initiating a transfer
- **Spoke chains** - Equivalent tokens are minted on the destination chain

When transferring tokens back to the original hub chain, the tokens on the source spoke chain are burned, and the previously locked tokens on the hub chain are unlocked. However, when transferring tokens directly between spoke chains, the tokens are burned on the source spoke chain and minted on the destination spoke chain.

## Burn-and-Mint

The burn-and-mint model involves burning tokens on the source chain and minting them on the destination chain. This results in a simplified multichain transfer process that distributes the total supply across multiple chains and produces a native multichain token.

This model best suits new token deployments or projects willing to upgrade existing contracts.

- **Source chain** - tokens are burned when initiating a transfer
- **Destination chain** - equivalent tokens are minted on the destination chain

## Introduction

Wormhole's Native Token Transfers (NTT) is an open source, flexible, and composable framework for transferring tokens across blockchains. By eliminating wrapped assets, NTT preserves each token’s native properties across chains, letting you maintain complete control over metadata, ownership, upgrade authority, and other custom features.

The framework offers two modes of operation for existing token deployments. In locking mode, the original token supply is preserved on a single chain. In contrast, the burning mode enables the deployment of multichain tokens, distributing the supply across various chains.

## Key Features

Wormhole's Native Token Transfers (NTT) framework offers a comprehensive and flexible solution for seamless token transfers across blockchains. Below are some of the key features that make this framework stand out:

- **No wrapped tokens** – tokens remain native on every chain where NTT is deployed. All token properties and metadata remain consistent, avoiding any confusion or overhead introduced by wrapped tokens
- **Unified user experience** - tokens retain their properties on each chain, remaining completely fungible and ensuring a consistent user experience
- **No liquidity pools** - transfer tokens without the need for liquidity pools, avoiding fees, slippage, and MEV risk
- **Integrator flexibility** - retained ownership, upgrade authority, and complete customizability over token contracts
- **Advanced rate limiting** - inbound and outbound rate limits are configurable per chain and over arbitrary periods, preventing abuse while managing network congestion and allowing for controlled deployments to new chains
- **Global Accountant** - ensures accounting integrity across chains by checking that the number of tokens burned and transferred out of a chain never exceeds the number of tokens minted
- **Access control** - to prevent unauthorized calls to administrative functions, protocols can choose to assign specific functions, such as the Pauser role, to a separate address from the owner
- **Maximum composability** - open source and extensible for widespread adoption and integration with other protocols
- **Custom attestation** - optionally add external verifiers and configure custom message attestation thresholds

## Integration Paths

Integrators looking to deploy their token to connected chains can use the NTT framework or the Token Bridge. Both options carry a distinct integration path and feature set depending on your requirements, as outlined in the following sections.

### Native Token Transfers Framework

The Native Token Transfers Framework is highly customizable and ideal for applications such as a DeFi governance token deployed across multiple chains, which seeks to achieve fungible multichain liquidity and direct integration into governance processes.

- **Mechanism** - can entirely utilize a burn-and-mint mechanism or can be paired for a hub-and-spoke model
- **Security** - fully configurable rate limiting, pausing, access control, and threshold attestations. Integrated with the Global Accountant
- **Contract ownership** - retain ownership and upgrade authority of token contracts on each chain
- **Token contracts** - native contracts owned by your protocol governance
- **Integration** - streamlined, customizable framework allows for more sophisticated and bespoke deployments

The following example projects demonstrate the use of the Wormhole NTT framework through Wormhole Connect and the TypeScript SDK:

- [NTT Connect](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-ntt-connect){target=\_blank} 
- [NTT TS SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-ntt-ts-sdk){target=\_blank} 

### Token Bridge

The Token Bridge offers a secure, low-effort integration suitable for applications like a Web3 game that wants to make its token tradable across multiple chains.

- **Mechanism** - solely utilizes a lock and mint model. Unlike NTT, the Token Bridge issues a wrapped asset on the destination chain, rather than preserving the original token contract
- **Security** - preconfigured rate limiting and integrated Global Accountant
- **Contract ownership** - Token Bridge contracts are upgradeable via [Wormhole Governance](/docs/learn/security/){target=\_blank}
- **Token contracts** - wrapped asset contract owned by the Wormhole Token Bridge contract, upgradeable via a 13/19 Guardian governance process
- **Integration** - straightforward and permissionless method to deploy on multiple chains

## Supported Token Standards

Native Token Transfers (NTT) in Wormhole primarily support **ERC-20 tokens**, the most widely used standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum network and other EVM-compatible blockchains. The NttManager contract leverages the IERC20 interface and SafeERC20 utility from OpenZeppelin to ensure secure and efficient token transfers. Additionally, it supports ERC-20 Burnable tokens, allowing tokens to be burned on the source chain when needed for cross-chain transfers. At this time, NTT focuses on ERC-20 tokens, and other token standards, such as ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens) or ERC-1155 (multi-token standard), are not natively supported.

# Security

## Global Accountant

The Global Accountant is a defense-in-depth security feature that checks the integrity of every token transfer. It ensures that chain balances remain isolated and more tokens cannot be burned and transferred out of a chain than were ever minted.

This feature ensures native asset fungibility remains in 1:1 parity. At no time will assets coming from a spoke chain exceed the number of native assets sent to that spoke chain. The Guardians, with their role in enforcing accounting transparency, provide a reassuring layer of security, attesting to a Native Token Transfer (NTT) only if it passes integrity checks.

[Contact](https://discord.com/invite/wormholecrypto){target=\_blank} Wormhole contributors if you are interested in configuring the Global Accountant for your multichain deployment.

## Governance and Upgradeability

Integrators should implement governance mechanisms to manage the addition and removal of transceivers and to upgrade contracts using proxy patterns, as demonstrated in the upgrade functions in the `NttManager` contracts. These processes can also set thresholds and rules for attestation and message approval.

The registry component of the NTT system is crucial for maintaining a trusted list of transceivers and managing their status. Governance processes for the following actions can be submitted directly to the corresponding contract on-chain, whether it is one or multiple of the bridging contracts or one of the token contracts:

- Adding or removing a transceiver address from the registry
- Setting the token contract address on a bridging contract
- Setting the Wormhole Core Contract address on a bridging contract
- Setting the registered bridging contract address on the token contract

This governance model ensures that the system remains secure while being adaptable to new requirements in any environment where it is deployed.

# Settlement Protocol Architecture

## Introduction

This page describes the high-level mechanics of the underlying native swap protocols in the Wormhole SDK. While built on Wormhole messaging, each protocol uses a novel architecture with unique price discovery, scalability, and latency tradeoffs. These designs enable redundancy to handle highly asymmetric flows and sharp volume changes. These sections will cover the following:

- **Wormhole Liquidity Layer** - a cross-chain transfer protocol that utilizes Solana as the central orchestration layer for cross-chain intents, allowing solvers to deploy liquidity from a single Solana-based hub rather than distributing it across each supported chain
- **Mayan Swift** - a flexible cross-chain intent protocol that embeds a competitive on-chain price auction to determine the best possible execution for the expressed user intent
- **Mayan MCTP** - a cross-chain intents protocol that leverages Circle's CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) mechanism and Wormhole messaging to enable secure, fee-managed asset transfers across chains

## Wormhole Liquidity Layer

Wormhole Liquidity Layer is a cross-chain transfer protocol that enables faster-than-finality transfers across the Wormhole ecosystem through a novel, Solana-based hub-and-spoke architecture. The hub-and-spoke model leverages interoperable token standards like Circle's CCTP (and Wormhole's NTT), allowing the solver to natively mint and burn assets between chains for intent fulfillment. This architecture allows solvers to facilitate cross-chain transfers by fronting assets on the destination chain and assuming the finality risk of the originating source chain transaction. 

Solvers concentrate their liquidity entirely on Solana, where they participate in permissionless on-chain English auctions (open ascending-price auctions where bidders publicly raise bids until only one bidder remains) to fulfill each cross-chain transfer. Upon the conclusion of each auction, the winning solver initiates a transfer from Solana to the specified destination chain. The solver rebalances inventory once the originating source chain transaction reaches finality and arrives to Solana.

![Wormhole Settlments Liquidity layer architecture diagram: source chain to hub to destination chain](/docs/images/learn/transfers/settlement/architecture/architecture-1.webp)

The Wormhole Liquidity Layer serves as the underlying chain abstraction infrastructure layer for protocols across Wormhole-connected ecosystems by enabling protocols to bundle call data containing arbitrary protocol actions, which can be executed atomically alongside each transfer. This feature allows developers to create fully chain-abstracted user experiences, including constructing natively cross-chain decentralized exchanges (DEXs), borrow-lend protocols, payment protocols, and other applications atop this layer.

### Solvers and Liquidity Fragmentation

Traditional intent-based protocols require solvers to distribute their capital across each supported chain in the network. This liquidity fragmentation leads to capital inefficiency and requires complex rebalancing to manage asymmetric flows between chains. As the number of chains increases, solvers face scalability challenges, which can result in market concentration, reducing competition and potentially impacting price discovery in intent execution.

Using a hub-and-spoke model, the Wormhole Liquidity Layer solves these challenges by consolidating solver liquidity on a single chain, Solana. This model eliminates the need for complex cross-chain rebalancing and simplifies solvers' infrastructure requirements. Solvers only need to consider the finality risk of the originating source chain transaction and the payload size when bidding on transfers. By concentrating liquidity on Solana, the protocol can handle large transfer volumes with a smaller capital base, enhancing capital efficiency and lowering barriers to entry for solvers. This approach promotes competition, improves overall market efficiency, and ultimately benefits users with better prices while still preserving the speed of transactions.

### Enable Unified Liquidity

The novel hub-and-spoke liquidity architecture relies on interoperable token standards that enable cross-chain token fungibility, such as Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) and Wormhole's Native Token Transfers (NTT). These protocols allow assets to move seamlessly between chains, making unified liquidity possible. On the liquidity hub (Solana), solvers concentrate their liquidity in NTT or CCTP-supported assets, such as USDC. These assets act as the shuttle between chains but may not necessarily be the user's original or final asset.

After the Solana auction concludes, the appropriate instructions are called on the CCTP or NTT contract, initiating the transfer from Solana to the destination chain by burning/locking the asset on Solana and sequentially minting on the destination chain. Solvers rebalance their inventory on Solana using these interoperable token standards as well. Once the originating source chain transaction reaches finality and arrives to Solana, the solver can redeem the NTT or CCTP message, minting the inventory for use once again.

By leveraging interoperable token standards like NTT, this model of liquidity facilitation for cross-chain intents can arbitrarily scale to any chain or ecosystem while preserving fully unified liquidity—eliminating the need for solver "buy-in" for new chain expansion. Additionally, this means new chains, even without proven traction, can access the same amount of liquidity for cross-chain intent fulfillment from day one of mainnet launch as they would if they were long-standing ecosystems with clear evidence of adoption — commonly overlooked by solvers who must aggressively prioritize high flow chains to due high opportunity costs. This includes new ecosystems without Centralized Exchange (CEX) enabled withdrawals.

### Protocol Flow: How It Works

1. **Initiation** - users or protocols initiate a transfer via an interface or directly on-chain. They choose between a standard transfer (waiting for finality on the sending chain) or a fast transfer (triggering the auction process). For fast transfers, users or the protocol specify a maximum fee and an auction start deadline

    !!! Note
        If an auction doesn't start within the set deadline, a standard transfer will proceed directly from the source to the destination chain.

2. **Auction** - solvers monitor the Wormhole network for these fast transfer requests and initiate an auction on Solana by offering to fulfill the transfer at or below the user's maximum fee. To start the auction, the solver must transfer the requested funds plus a small security deposit to the Matching Engine contract
3. **Competition** - once initiated, other solvers can participate by submitting lower bids in a simple English auction, aiming to provide users with the best rate. If a new solver submits a better offer, the previous solver's funds and security deposit are returned, with the latest offer taking precedence atomically. This competition ensures that users receive the best possible transfer rate
4. **Fulfillment** - after the auction concludes, the winning solver must complete the transfer within a predefined grace period to earn their fee and reclaim their security deposit. Failure to do so may result in the security deposit being slashed, with the slashed amount compensating the user for delays. This mechanism incentivizes prompt execution. Upon successful completion, the Fast Transfer hub sends the USDC to the user's destination wallet, and the solver receives their security deposit and transfer fee
5. **Settlement** - once the source chain transaction reaches finality, the winning solver can use the finalized Wormhole message to settle the auction with the matching engine and rebalance. This allows the solver to retrieve the original transfer amount into their wallet

## Mayan Swift

Mayan Swift is a flexible cross-chain intent protocol that embeds a competitive on-chain price auction to determine the best possible execution for the expressed user intent.

### On-Chain Competitive Price Discovery Mechanism

Traditional intent-based protocols essentially function as cross-chain limit orders. If the order is profitable, solvers will compete to fulfill it, leading to MEV-like competition focused on speed. While functional, this methodology presents two clear inefficiencies and drawbacks.

First, they lack a competitive price discovery mechanism as limit order prices are typically determined through centralized off-chain systems. Second, in this MEV-like market structure, only a single solver can win, while the others lose out on transaction fees. This dynamic of deadweight loss results in solvers prioritizing high-margin orders, ultimately resulting in elevated fees for end-users without commensurate benefits.

Mayan Swift addresses these limitations by implementing competitive on-chain English auctions on Solana as an embedded price discovery mechanism, fundamentally shifting solver competition from speed-based to price-based execution. Through this architecture, the solver offering the best possible price secures the right to fulfill the order within pre-specified deadline parameters.

![Mayan Swift - Intent-centric design](/docs/images/learn/transfers/settlement/architecture/architecture-2.webp)

### Protocol Flow: How It Works

1. **Initiation** - the user creates an order by signing a transaction that locks one of the primary assets (USDC or ETH) into the Mayan smart contract, specifying the desired outcome. 

    !!!note
        If the input asset is not a primary asset, it is converted into a primary asset within the same transaction before the order is submitted.

    Each order includes properties such as destination chain, destination wallet address, output token address, minimum output amount, gas drop amount, deadline, and 32 bytes of random hex to prevent collisions. A Keccak-256 hash is then calculated to identify the order

2. **Auction** - solvers observe on-chain data or subscribe to the Mayan explorer web socket (solvers using the Mayan explorer verify the order's integrity by checking the data against the on-chain hash). Once the new order is verified, an on-chain auction on Solana is initiated by passing the order ID and the bid amount, which cannot be lower than the minimum amount. Other solvers can increase the bid by submitting a higher amount before the auction ends
3. **Fulfillment** - the auction ends three seconds after the initial bid. Once the auction ends, the winning solver can execute an instruction that passes their wallet address on the destination chain. This triggers a Wormhole message containing the order ID and the winner's wallet address. Wormhole Guardians then sign this message, allowing the winning solver to fulfill the order on the destination chain by submitting proof of their win and the promised amount to the Mayan contract before the deadline. The Mayan contract deducts a protocol fee (currently 3 basis points) and a referral fee (if applicable), transferring the remaining amount to the user's destination wallet. It also triggers a Wormhole message as proof of fulfillment
4. **Settlement** - after the Wormhole Guardians sign the fulfillment message, the winning solver can submit this message on the source chain to unlock the user's funds and transfer them to their own wallet. Upon fulfillment, the solver has the option to delay triggering a Wormhole message immediately. Instead, they can batch the proofs and, once the batch reaches a certain threshold, issue a batched proof to unlock all orders simultaneously, saving on gas fees

## Mayan MCTP

Mayan MCTP is a cross-chain intents protocol that leverages Circle's CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) mechanism and Wormhole messaging to enable secure, fee-managed asset transfers across chains.

![Mayan MCTP diagram](/docs/images/learn/transfers/settlement/architecture/architecture-3.webp)

### Protocol Flow: How It Works

1. **Initiation** - the user creates an order by signing a transaction that locks one USDC into the Mayan smart contract, specifying the desired outcome. 

    !!!note
        If the input asset is not USDC, it is converted into a primary asset within the same transaction before the order is submitted.
    
    The contract constructs a `BridgeWithFeeMsg` structure, which includes parameters such as the action type, payload type, nonce, destination address, gas drop, redeem fee, and an optional custom payload hash

2. **Intent submission** - the contract calls the CCTP messenger to deposit the tokens for bridging. A unique nonce is generated, and a corresponding fee-lock record is created in the contract's storage. This record includes the locked fee, gas drop parameters, and destination details. The constructed message is hashed and published through Wormhole. The protocol fee is deducted during this step, and the Wormhole message is broadcast with the specified [consistency (finality) level](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank}
3. **Fulfillment** - on the destination chain, the protocol receives a CCTP message with corresponding signatures and verifies the payload using Wormhole's verification mechanism. Once validated, the redeemed tokens are transferred to the intended recipient, deducting the redeem fee as per protocol rules

The protocol provides mechanisms for unlocking the fee once the bridging process is completed. This can occur immediately upon fulfillment or be batched for efficiency. In the fee unlock flow, the contract verifies the unlock message via Wormhole and then releases the locked fee to the designated unlocker address.

# Wormhole Settlement Overview

## Introduction

Wormhole Settlement is a fast, institutional-scale digital asset settlement — a new way to transfer assets across chains.

With Wormhole Settlement, an intent-based asset transfer for individual users and institutions, you can swap, bridge, and build across multiple chains. You can implement cross-chain functionality within your dApps extremely simply and without compromising user experience, widening the horizons of your product offerings and the number and type of users you can cater to.

The Settlement supports Ethereum, Ton, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Unichain, Polygon, Solana, and Sui, with many more on the horizon. It is powered by Wormhole Messaging, Wormhole Native Token Transfer (NTT), and Circle's CCTP and built in collaboration with the intent experts at Mayan Finance.

Settlement represents Wormhole's first step towards optimizing the bridging experience and building a product that users and institutions use daily. Use it to send assets between chains, rebalance institutional inventories on-chain cheaply and quickly, or allow your application to be accessible by any user no matter what assets they hold or what chain they call home.

## Key Features

- **Integrator flexibility** - apps leveraging the SDK can select any one of three potential routes surfaced, each with its tradeoffs concerning time vs cost; they may extend this to users as well
- **Scalable liquidity** - taking into account the sometimes idiosyncratic yet sharp inflows into the Solana ecosystem, the hub-spoke model of the Wormhole Liquidity Layer and the flexible design of Swift are designed for capital efficiency
- **Arbitrary payload support** - integrators can bundle `callData` containing arbitrary protocol actions to enable seamless one-click user experiences, such as swap plus stake

## Integrator Paths

### SDK Integrators

Wormhole provides an SDK that enables apps to abstract away the complexity of cross-chain token swaps. The SDK handles route discovery, fee estimation, and transaction construction. Apps can embed this feature in their backend or create an interface for users to bridge into their respective ecosystems quickly.

### NTT Integrators

NTT partners, current and future, can leverage Wormhole Settlement for near-instant NTT transfers from any chain, including Ethereum mainnet and its L2s. This eliminates waiting for slow source chain confirmation times (sometimes 15 minutes or more). If interested, please [fill out this interest form](https://wormhole.com/contact){target=\_blank}.

### Chain Integrators

Due to the hub-spoke model of liquidity, new chains without proven traction can access the same level of liquidity for cross-chain intent fulfillment from day one of mainnet launch as established ecosystems with clear evidence of adoption.

# Token Bridge

Transferring tokens across blockchain networks is challenging due to the lack of interoperability. Maintaining token properties such as value, name, and precision while ensuring security during transfers often requires complex and costly solutions like liquidity pools or native swaps, which can introduce inefficiencies and risks.

Wormhole’s Token Bridge addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized protocol for seamless cross-chain token transfers through a lock-and-mint mechanism. Using Wormhole’s message-passing protocol, the Token Bridge allows standards-compliant tokens, like ERC-20 on Ethereum or SPL on Solana, to be transferred between different blockchains while preserving their original attributes.

Offering a more efficient, scalable, and secure alternative to traditional solutions, the Token Bridge ensures that assets retain their properties across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Additionally, it supports flexible features like [Token Transfers with Messages](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/#token-transfer-with-message){target=\_blank}, enabling custom interactions by allowing tokens to carry additional data for smart contract integration on the destination chain.

This page introduces the core concepts and functions of Wormhole’s Token Bridge, explaining how it operates, its key features, and how it enables secure and efficient cross-chain token transfers.

### How Does It Work?

At the core of the Token Bridge lies the lock-and-mint mechanism, which uses the [Core Contract](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} with a specific [payload](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/#token-transfer){target=\_blank} to pass information about the transfer. Tokens on the source chain are locked, and wrapped tokens are minted on the destination chain. This approach guarantees that token transfers are secure and consistent, ensuring that token properties such as name, symbol, and decimal precision are preserved across chains.

Before a token can be transferred to a new chain, the token’s metadata must be [attested](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/#attestation){target=\_blank}. This process registers the token details (such as decimals and symbol) on the destination chain, enabling the creation of wrapped assets.

While the [Core Contract](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} has no specific receiver by default, transfers sent through the Token Bridge do have a specific receiver chain and address to ensure the tokens are minted to the expected recipient.

In addition to standard token transfers, the Token Bridge supports [Token Transfers with Messages](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/#token-transfer-with-message){target=\_blank}. This functionality allows users to attach additional data to token transfers, enabling more complex interactions with smart contracts on the destination chain. For instance, a token transfer can include a payload that triggers specific actions, such as interacting with a decentralized exchange (DEX) or automated market maker (AMM).

### Token Transfer Flow

The transfer process is simple yet secure, involving a few key steps:

1. **Attestation** - first, a token's metadata is attested on the source chain, ensuring that its properties are consistent across chains
2. **Locking** - on the source chain, the native token is locked in a custody account
3. **Message emission** - a message detailing the transfer is sent through Wormhole’s Guardian Network, which verifies the transfer and signs the message
4. **Verification and minting** - on the destination chain, the transfer message is verified, and wrapped tokens are minted, or native tokens are released from custody

![Token Bridge detailed flow](/docs/images/learn/transfers/token-bridge/token-bridge-diagram.webp)

### Key Features of the Token Bridge

The Token Bridge creates wrapped versions when tokens are transferred to a different chain. These wrapped assets represent the locked tokens on the source chain and allow users to interact with them on the destination chain. This mechanism ensures seamless functionality without needing liquidity pools or native token swaps.

The Token Bridge employs a universal token representation that is compatible with various virtual machine (VM) data types. This allows the tokens to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) across different chains without issues related to differing token standards.

### Message and Payload Structure

To facilitate cross-chain communication, the Token Bridge uses specialized payloads that carry the necessary information for token transfers and attestations. These payloads ensure that the correct tokens are minted or unlocked on the destination chain.

- `Transfer` - this payload initiates the transfer of tokens, either by minting wrapped tokens or releasing locked tokens
- `TransferWithPayload` - in addition to transferring tokens, this payload carries additional data, allowing integration with smart contracts or dApps on the target chain
- `AssetMeta` - before a token can be transferred for the first time, this payload is used to attest to the token’s metadata, including decimals, symbol, and name
- `RegisterChain` - register the Token Bridge contract (emitter address) for a foreign chain
- `UpgradeContract` - upgrade the contract

Each payload type is designed to serve a specific function in the token transfer process, ensuring that the bridge operates efficiently and securely.

One of the key challenges in cross-chain token transfers is maintaining the correct token precision. The Token Bridge addresses this using the `AssetMeta` payload to store token metadata. Before transferring a token to a new chain, metadata such as its decimal precision, name, and symbol must be attested. The bridge ensures token amounts are truncated to a maximum of 8 decimals, guaranteeing compatibility with chains that may not support higher decimal precision. For example, an 18-decimal token on Ethereum will be represented with only eight decimals on the destination chain, simplifying integration with various decentralized applications.

### Security and Authorization

The Token Bridge uses an emitter chain and address authorization system to verify the validity of messages. Each Token Bridge endpoint is registered on its respective chain, ensuring only trusted contracts can send or receive transfer messages.

The [Wormhole Guardian Network](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/#guardian-network){target=\_blank} plays a critical role in verifying each transfer and ensuring that the message is signed and relayed securely between chains.

### Portal Bridge

A real-world example of Wormhole's Token Bridge in action is the [Portal Bridge](https://portalbridge.com/){target=\_blank}, which provides users with a simple interface to transfer tokens across multiple blockchains. Using the Wormhole infrastructure, Portal Bridge guarantees secure and seamless cross-chain transfers, making it easier for users to move assets between different blockchain ecosystems.

# Integrate Connect into a React DApp

:simple-github: [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-basic-connect){target=\_blank}

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to integrate [Wormhole Connect](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect){target=\_blank} to enable cross-chain token transfers and interactions. Wormhole Connect offers a simplified interface for developers to facilitate seamless token transfers between blockchains. Using Wormhole Connect, you can easily bridge assets across multiple ecosystems without diving into the complex mechanics of cross-chain communication.

While this tutorial will guide you through the process using a specific blockchain as an example, the principles and steps outlined here can be applied to any blockchain supported by Wormhole. In this example, we’ll work with Sui as our source blockchain and Avalanche Fuji as the destination blockchain.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Wormhole Connect, we'll first need to set up a basic environment that allows for cross-chain token transfers.
Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank} installed on your machine
- A [Sui wallet](https://suiwallet.com/){target=\_blank} set up and ready for use
- A [compatible wallet](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/5520938-what-are-the-official-avalanche-wallets){target=\_blank} for Avalanche Fuji, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/){target=\_blank} 
- Testnet tokens for [Sui](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/get-coins){target=\_blank} and [Fuji](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c){target=\_blank} to cover gas fees 

## Set Up Connect for Sui Transfers

### Create a React Project

Start by setting up your React app:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app connect-tutorial
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd connect-tutorial
    ```

### Install Wormhole Connect

Next, install the Wormhole Connect package as a dependency by running the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
npm install @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect
```

### Integrate Connect into the Application

Now, we need to modify the default `App.js` file to integrate Wormhole Connect. We are going to use [version V1.0](/docs/build/transfers/connect/upgrade/){target=\_blank}, make sure to check which version of connect you are using. Open `src/App.js` and replace the content with the following code:

=== "JavaScript"

    ```js
    import logo from './logo.svg';
    import './App.css';
    import WormholeConnect from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

    const config = {
        network: 'Testnet',
        chains: ['Sui', 'Avalanche'],
    };

    function App() {
        return <WormholeConnect config={config}/>;
    }

    export default App;
    ``` 

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import './App.css';
    import WormholeConnect, {
        WormholeConnectConfig,
        WormholeConnectTheme,
    } from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

    function App() {
        const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
            network: 'Testnet',
            chains: ['Sui', 'Avalanche'],

            ui: {
                title: 'SUI Connect TS Demo',
            },
        };

        const theme: WormholeConnectTheme = {
            mode: 'dark',
            primary: '#78c4b6',
        };

        return <WormholeConnect config={config} theme={theme} />;
    }

    export default App;
    ```

- Set `network` to `testnet` - this ensures that Wormhole Connect uses the testnet environment
- Set `chains` to `['Sui', 'Avalanche']` - configures the app to allow transfers between Sui and Avalanche Fuji, the testnet for Avalanche

### Customize Wormhole Connect

To further customize Wormhole Connect for your application, such as adjusting the UI, adding custom tokens, or configuring specific chain settings, you can refer to the [Wormhole Connect Configuration guide](/docs/build/transfers/connect/configuration/#introduction){target=\_blank}. 

### Run the Application

Make sure you’re in the root directory of your React app, and run the following command to start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

Now your React app should be up and running, and Wormhole Connect should be visible on `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see the Wormhole Connect component, which will include a UI for selecting networks and tokens for cross-chain transfers.

## Transfer Tokens from Sui to Fuji

Before transferring token ensure you have enough testnet SUI and Fuji tokens to cover the gas fees for the transfer. 

To transfer tokens from Sui to Fuji in the Wormhole Connect interface:

1. Select **Sui** as the source network, connect your Sui wallet, and choose **SUI** as the asset you wish to transfer
2. Choose **Fuji** as the destination network and connect your wallet with the Fuji network
3. Enter the amount of SUI tokens you wish to transfer

    ![](/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/connect/react-dapp/connect-1.webp)

4. Choose to view other routes 
    
    ![](/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/connect/react-dapp/connect-2.webp)

5. Select the manual bridge option, which will require two transactions: one on the source chain (Sui) and one on the destination chain (Fuji)

    !!! note
        It is recommended to use the manual bridge option for this tutorial. The automatic bridge feature is currently undergoing improvements, while the manual bridge ensures that transfers complete successfully.

    ![](/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/connect/react-dapp/connect-3.webp)

6. Review and confirm the transfer on Sui. This will lock your tokens on the Sui chain

    ![](/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/connect/react-dapp/connect-4.webp)

7. Follow the on-screen prompts to approve the transaction. You will be asked to sign with your Sui wallet

    ![](/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/connect/react-dapp/connect-5.webp)

Once the transaction has been submitted, Wormhole Connect will display the progress of the transfer. Monitor the status until you’re prompted to complete the transaction on the destination chain. You can also track your transactions on [Wormholescan](https://wormholescan.io/#/?network=Testnet){target=\_blank}.

## Claim Tokens on Fuji

After the Sui transaction is complete, confirm the final transaction on Fuji by claiming the wrapped tokens. You will be asked to confirm the transaction with your Fuji wallet.

![](/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/connect/react-dapp/connect-6.webp)

Once confirmed, check your Fuji wallet to verify that the wrapped SUI tokens have been successfully received.

![](/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/connect/react-dapp/connect-7.webp)

# Create Cross-Chain Messaging Contracts

:simple-github: [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-wormhole-messaging){target=\_blank}

## Introduction

Wormhole's cross-chain messaging allows smart contracts to interact seamlessly across multiple blockchains. This enables developers to build decentralized applications that leverage the strengths of different networks, whether it's Avalanche, Celo, Ethereum, or beyond. In this tutorial, we'll explore using [Wormhole's Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank} to create cross-chain contracts to send and receive messages across chains.

Wormhole's messaging infrastructure simplifies data transmission, event triggering, and transaction initiation across blockchains. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through a simple yet powerful hands-on demonstration that showcases this practical capability. We'll deploy contracts on two Testnets—Avalanche Fuji and Celo Alfajores—and send messages from one chain to another. This tutorial is perfect for those new to cross-chain development and seeking hands-on experience with Wormhole's powerful toolkit.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have not only built a fully functioning cross-chain message sender and receiver using Solidity but also developed a comprehensive understanding of how to interact with the Wormhole relayer, manage cross-chain costs, and ensure your smart contracts are configured correctly on both source and target chains.

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of Solidity and smart contract development. Before diving in, it may be helpful to review [the basics of Wormhole](/docs/learn/){target=\_blank} to familiarize yourself with the protocol.

## Wormhole Overview

We'll interact with two key Wormhole components: the [Wormhole relayer](/docs/learn/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank} and the [Wormhole Core Contracts](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank}. The relayer handles cross-chain message delivery and ensures the message is accurately received on the target chain. This allows smart contracts to communicate across blockchains without developers worrying about the underlying complexity.

Additionally, we'll rely on the Wormhole relayer to automatically determine cross-chain transaction costs and facilitate payments. This feature simplifies cross-chain development by allowing you to specify only the target chain and the message. The relayer handles the rest, ensuring that the message is transmitted with the appropriate fee.

## Build Cross-Chain Messaging Contracts

In this section, we'll deploy two smart contracts: one to send a message from Avalanche Fuji and another to receive it on Celo Alfajores. The contracts interact with the Wormhole relayer to transmit messages across chains.

At a high level, our contracts will:

1. Send a message from Avalanche to Celo using the Wormhole relayer
2. Receive and process the message on Celo, logging the content of the message

Before diving into the deployment steps, let's first break down key parts of the contracts.

### Sender Contract: MessageSender

The `MessageSender` contract is responsible for quoting the cost of sending a message cross-chain and then sending that message. 

Key functions include:

 - **`quoteCrossChainCost`** - calculates the cost of delivering a message to the target chain using the Wormhole relayer
 - **`sendMessage`** - encodes the message and sends it to the target chain and contract address using the Wormhole relayer

Here's the core of the contract:

```solidity
uint16 targetChain,
        address targetAddress,
        string memory message
    ) external payable {
        uint256 cost = quoteCrossChainCost(targetChain);

        require(
            msg.value >= cost,
            "Insufficient funds for cross-chain delivery"
        );

        wormholeRelayer.sendPayloadToEvm{value: cost}(
            targetChain,
            targetAddress,
            abi.encode(message, msg.sender),
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT
        );
    }
```

You can find the full code for the `MessageSender.sol` below.

contract MessageSender {
    IWormholeRelayer public wormholeRelayer;
    uint256 constant GAS_LIMIT = 50000;

    constructor(address _wormholeRelayer) {
        wormholeRelayer = IWormholeRelayer(_wormholeRelayer);
    }

    function quoteCrossChainCost(
        uint16 targetChain
    ) public view returns (uint256 cost) {
        (cost, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
            targetChain,
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT
        );
    }

    function sendMessage(
        uint16 targetChain,
        address targetAddress,
        string memory message
    ) external payable {
        uint256 cost = quoteCrossChainCost(targetChain);

        require(
            msg.value >= cost,
            "Insufficient funds for cross-chain delivery"
        );

        wormholeRelayer.sendPayloadToEvm{value: cost}(
            targetChain,
            targetAddress,
            abi.encode(message, msg.sender),
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT
        );
    }
}
    ```

### Receiver Contract: MessageReceiver

The `MessageReceiver` contract handles incoming cross-chain messages. When a message arrives, it decodes the payload and logs the message content. It ensures that only authorized contracts can send and process messages, adding an extra layer of security in cross-chain communication.

#### Emitter Validation and Registration

In cross-chain messaging, validating the sender is essential to prevent unauthorized contracts from sending messages. The `isRegisteredSender` modifier ensures that messages can only be processed if they come from the registered contract on the source chain. This guards against malicious messages and enhances security.

Key implementation details include:

 - **`registeredSender`** - stores the address of the registered sender contract
 - **`setRegisteredSender`** - registers the sender's contract address on the source chain. It ensures that only registered contracts can send messages, preventing unauthorized senders
 - **`isRegisteredSender`** - restricts the processing of messages to only those from registered senders, preventing unauthorized cross-chain communication

```solidity

require(
            registeredSenders[sourceChain] == sourceAddress,
            "Not registered sender"
        );
        _;
    }

    function setRegisteredSender(
        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32 sourceAddress
    ) public {
        require(
            msg.sender == registrationOwner,
            "Not allowed to set registered sender"
        );
        registeredSenders[sourceChain] = sourceAddress;
    }
```

#### Message Processing

The `receiveWormholeMessages` is the core function that processes the received message. It checks that the Wormhole relayer sent the message, decodes the payload, and emits an event with the message content. It is essential to verify the message sender to prevent unauthorized messages.

```solidity
bytes memory payload,
        bytes[] memory,
        bytes32 sourceAddress,
        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32
    ) public payable override isRegisteredSender(sourceChain, sourceAddress) {
        require(
            msg.sender == address(wormholeRelayer),
            "Only the Wormhole relayer can call this function"
        );

        // Decode the payload to extract the message
        string memory message = abi.decode(payload, (string));

        // Example use of sourceChain for logging
        if (sourceChain != 0) {
            emit SourceChainLogged(sourceChain);
        }

        // Emit an event with the received message
        emit MessageReceived(message);
    }
```

You can find the full code for the `MessageReceiver.sol` below.

    constructor(address _wormholeRelayer) {
        wormholeRelayer = IWormholeRelayer(_wormholeRelayer);
        registrationOwner = msg.sender; // Set contract deployer as the owner
    }

    modifier isRegisteredSender(uint16 sourceChain, bytes32 sourceAddress) {
        require(
            registeredSenders[sourceChain] == sourceAddress,
            "Not registered sender"
        );

    }

        bytes memory payload,
        bytes[] memory,

        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32
    ) public payable override isRegisteredSender(sourceChain, sourceAddress) {

            "Only the Wormhole relayer can call this function"
        );

        // Decode the payload to extract the message
        string memory message = abi.decode(payload, (string));

        // Example use of sourceChain for logging
        if (sourceChain != 0) {
            emit SourceChainLogged(sourceChain);
        }

        // Emit an event with the received message
        emit MessageReceived(message);
    }
}
    ```

## Deploy Contracts

This section will guide you through deploying the cross-chain messaging contracts on the Avalanche Fuji and Celo Alfajores Testnets. Follow these steps to get your contracts up and running.

### Deployment Tools
We use _Foundry_ to deploy our smart contracts. However, you can use any tool you're comfortable with, such as:

 - [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank} for a browser-based IDE
 - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#installation){target=\_blank} for a more extensive JavaScript/TypeScript workflow
 - [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank} for a CLI-focused experience with built-in scripting and testing features

The contracts and deployment steps remain the same regardless of your preferred tool. The key is to ensure you have the necessary Testnet funds and are deploying to the right networks.

### Repository Setup

To get started with cross-chain messaging using Wormhole, first clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-wormhole-messaging){target=\_blank}. This repository includes everything you need to deploy, interact, and test the message flow between chains.

This demo focuses on using the scripts, so it's best to take a look at them, starting with `deploySender.ts`, `deployReceiver.ts`, and `sendMessage.ts`.

To configure the dependencies properly, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

The repository includes:

- Two Solidity contracts:

    - **`MessageSender.sol`** - contract that sends the cross-chain message from Avalanche
    - **`MessageReceiver.sol`** - contract that receives the cross-chain message on Celo

- Deployment scripts located in the `script` directory:

    - **`deploySender.ts`** - deploys the `MessageSender` contract to Avalanche
    - **`deployReceiver.ts`** - deploys the `MessageReceiver` contract to Celo
    - **`sendMessage.ts`** - sends a message from Avalanche to Celo

- Configuration files and ABI JSON files for easy deployment and interaction:

    - **`chains.json`** - configuration file that stores key information for the supported Testnets, including the Wormhole relayer addresses, RPC URLs, and chain IDs. You likely won't need to modify this file unless you're working with different networks

 - A dedicated `interfaces` directory inside the `src` folder for TypeScript type definitions:

    - **`ChainsConfig.ts`** - defines the types for the `chains.json` configuration file
    - **`DeployedContracts.ts`** - contains types for deployed contract addresses and related information
    - **`MessageJsons.ts`** - includes types for ABI and bytecode JSONs used by the deployment scripts
    - **`index.ts`** - serves as an export aggregator for the interfaces, simplifying imports in other files

### Important Setup Steps

1. **Add your private key** - create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your private key:
    
    ```env
    touch .env
    ```

    Inside `.env`, add your private key in the following format:

    ```env
    PRIVATE_KEY=INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

2. **Compile the contracts** - ensure everything is set up correctly by compiling the contracts:

    ```bash
    forge build
    ```

The expected output should be similar to this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>forge build</span>
	<span data-ty> > [⠒] Compiling...</span>
	<span data-ty> > [⠰] Compiling 30 files with 0.8.23</span>
	<span data-ty> [⠔] Solc 0.8.23 finished in 2.29s</span>
	<span data-ty>Compiler run successful!</span>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

### Deployment Process

Both deployment scripts, `deploySender.ts` and `deployReceiver.ts`, perform the following key tasks:

1. **Load configuration and contract details** - each script begins by loading the necessary configuration details, such as the network's RPC URL and the contract's ABI and bytecode. This information is essential for deploying the contract to the correct blockchain network

    === "`chains.json`"

        ```json
        {
    "chains": [
        {
            "description": "Avalanche testnet fuji",
            "chainId": 6,
            "rpc": "https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc",
            "tokenBridge": "0x61E44E506Ca5659E6c0bba9b678586fA2d729756",
            "wormholeRelayer": "0xA3cF45939bD6260bcFe3D66bc73d60f19e49a8BB",
            "wormhole": "0x7bbcE28e64B3F8b84d876Ab298393c38ad7aac4C"
        },
        {
            "description": "Celo Testnet",
            "chainId": 14,
            "rpc": "https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org",
            "tokenBridge": "0x05ca6037eC51F8b712eD2E6Fa72219FEaE74E153",
            "wormholeRelayer": "0x306B68267Deb7c5DfCDa3619E22E9Ca39C374f84",
            "wormhole": "0x88505117CA88e7dd2eC6EA1E13f0948db2D50D56"
        }
    ]
}
        ```

    === "`deploySender.ts`"

        ```typescript
        const chains: ChainsConfig = JSON.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(
      path.resolve(__dirname, '../deploy-config/chains.json'),
      'utf8'
    )
  );

  // Get the Avalanche Fuji configuration
  const avalancheChain = chains.chains.find((chain) =>
    chain.description.includes('Avalanche testnet')
  );
        ```

    === "`deployReceiver.ts`"

        ```typescript
        const chains: ChainsConfig = JSON.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(
      path.resolve(__dirname, '../deploy-config/chains.json'),
      'utf8'
    )
  );

  // Get the Celo Testnet configuration
  const celoChain = chains.chains.find((chain) =>
    chain.description.includes('Celo Testnet')
  );
        ```

    !!! note
        The `chains.json` file contains the configuration details for the Avalanche Fuji and Celo Alfajores Testnets. You can modify this file to add more networks if needed. For a complete list of contract addresses, visit the [reference page](/docs/build/reference/){target=\_blank}.

2. **Set up provider and wallet** - the scripts establish a connection to the blockchain using a provider and create a wallet instance using a private key. This wallet is responsible for signing the deployment transaction

    === "`deploySender.ts`"

        ```typescript
        const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
        ```

    === "`deployReceiver.ts`"

        ```typescript
        const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
        ```

3. **Deploy the contract** - the contract is deployed to the network specified in the configuration. Upon successful deployment, the contract address is returned, which is crucial for interacting with the contract later on

    === "`deploySender.ts`"

        ```typescript
        avalancheChain.wormholeRelayer
  );
  await senderContract.waitForDeployment();
        ```

    === "`deployReceiver.ts`"

        ```typescript
        celoChain.wormholeRelayer
  );
  await receiverContract.waitForDeployment();
        ```

4. **Register the `MessageSender` on the target chain** - after you deploy the `MessageReceiver` contract on the Celo Alfajores network, the sender contract address from Avalanche Fuji needs to be registered. This ensures that only messages from the registered `MessageSender` contract are processed

    This additional step is essential to enforce emitter validation, preventing unauthorized senders from delivering messages to the `MessageReceiver` contract

    ```typescript
    const avalancheSenderAddress = deployedContracts.avalanche?.MessageSender;
  if (!avalancheSenderAddress) {
    throw new Error('Avalanche MessageSender address not found.');
  }

  // Define the source chain ID for Avalanche Fuji
  const sourceChainId = 6;

  // Call setRegisteredSender on the MessageReceiver contract
  const tx = await (receiverContract as any).setRegisteredSender(
    sourceChainId,
    ethers.zeroPadValue(avalancheSenderAddress, 32)
  );
  await tx.wait();
    ```

You can find the full code for the `deploySender.ts` and `deployReceiver.ts` below.

### Deploy the Sender Contract

The sender contract will handle quoting and sending messages cross-chain.

1. Run the following command to deploy the sender contract:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy:sender
    ```

2. Once deployed, the contract address will be displayed. You may check the contract on the [Avalanche Fuji Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/){target=\_blank}

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
	<span data-ty="input"
		><span class="file-path"></span>npm run deploy:sender</span
	>
	<span data-ty> > wormhole-cross-chain@1.0.0 deploy:sender</span>
	<span data-ty> > node script/deploySender.ts</span>
	<span data-ty> MessageSender deployed to: 0xf5c474f335fFf617fA6FD04DCBb17E20ee0cEfb1</span>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>


### Deploy the Receiver Contract

The receiver contract listens for cross-chain messages and logs them when received.

1. Deploy the receiver contract with this command:
    
    ```bash
    npm run deploy:receiver
    ```

2. After deployment, note down the contract address. You may check the contract on the [Celo Alfajores Explorer](https://alfajores.celoscan.io/){target=\_blank}.


## Send a Cross-Chain Message

Now that both the sender and receiver contracts are deployed, let's move on to the next exciting step: sending a cross-chain message from Avalanche Fuji to Celo Alfajores.

In this example, we will use the `sendMessage.ts` script to transmit a message from the sender contract on Avalanche to the receiver contract on Celo. The script uses [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank} to interact with the deployed contracts, calculate the cross-chain cost dynamically, and handle the transaction.

Let's break down the script step by step.

1. **Load configuration files**

    1. **`chains.json`** - contains details about the supported Testnet chains, such as RPC URLs and relayer addresses
    2. **`deployedContracts.json`** - stores the addresses of the deployed sender and receiver contracts. This file is dynamically updated when contracts are deployed, but users can also manually add their own deployed contract addresses if needed

    ```typescript
    fs.readFileSync(
      path.resolve(__dirname, '../deploy-config/chains.json'),
      'utf8'
    )
  );

  const deployedContracts: DeployedContracts = JSON.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(
      path.resolve(__dirname, '../deploy-config/deployedContracts.json'),
      'utf8'
    )
  );
    ```

2. **Configure the provider and signer** - the script first reads the chain configurations and extracts the contract addresses. One essential step in interacting with a blockchain is setting up a _provider_. A provider is your connection to the blockchain network. It allows your script to interact with the blockchain, retrieve data, and send transactions. In this case, we're using a JSON-RPC provider

    Next, we configure the wallet, which will be used to sign transactions. The wallet is created using the private key and the provider. This ensures that all transactions sent from this wallet are broadcast to the Avalanche Fuji network:
        
    ```typescript
    const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
    ```

    After setting up the wallet, the script loads the ABI for the `MessageSender.sol` contract and creates an instance of it:

    ```typescript
    fs.readFileSync(
      path.resolve(__dirname, '../out/MessageSender.sol/MessageSender.json'),
      'utf8'
    )
  );
    ```

3. **Set up the message details** - the next part of the script defines the target chain (Celo) and the target address (the receiver contract on Celo):

    ```typescript
    const targetAddress = deployedContracts.celo.MessageReceiver;
    ```

    You can customize the message that will be sent across chains:

    ```typescript
    
    ```

4. **Estimate cross-chain cost** - before sending the message, we dynamically calculate the cross-chain cost using the `quoteCrossChainCost` function:

    ```typescript
    
    ```

    This ensures that the transaction includes enough funds to cover the gas fees for the cross-chain message.

5. **Send a message** - with everything set up, the message is sent using the `sendMessage` function:

    ```typescript
    targetChain,
    targetAddress,
    message,
    {
      value: txCost,
    }
  );
    ```

    After sending, the script waits for the transaction to be confirmed:

    ```typescript
    
    ```

6. **Run the script** - to send the message, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run send:message
    ```

If everything is set up correctly, the message will be sent from the Avalanche Fuji Testnet to the Celo Alfajores Testnet. You can monitor the transaction and verify that the message was received on Celo using the [Wormhole Explorer](https://wormholescan.io/#/?network=TESTNET){target=\_blank}.

The console should output something similar to this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
	<span data-ty="input"
		><span class="file-path"></span>npm run send:message</span
	>

# Create Cross-Chain Token Transfer Contracts

:simple-github: [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-cross-chain-token-transfer){target=\_blank}

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a simple cross-chain token transfer system using the Wormhole protocol via the [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank}. We'll guide you through building and deploying smart contracts that enable seamless token transfers of IERC-20 tokens between blockchains. Whether you're a developer looking to explore cross-chain applications or just interested in the Wormhole protocol, this guide will help you understand the fundamentals.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working cross-chain token transfer system built with the powerful tools provided by the Wormhole Solidity SDK, which you can further customize and integrate into your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank} installed on your machine
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation){target=\_blank} for deploying contracts
- Testnet tokens for [Avalanche-Fuji](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?token=C){target=\_blank} and [Celo-Alfajores](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores){target=\_blank} to cover gas fees
- [USDC Testnet](https://faucet.circle.com/){target=\_blank} tokens on Avalanche-Fuji or/and Celo-Alfajores for cross-chain transfer
- Wallet private key

## Valid Tokens for Transfer

It's important to note that this tutorial leverages [Wormhole's TokenBridge](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/6130bbb6f456b42b789a71f7ea2fd049d632d2fb/ethereum/contracts/bridge/TokenBridge.sol){target=\_blank} to transfer tokens between chains. So, the tokens you'd like to transfer must have an attestation on the `TokenBridge` contract of the target blockchain.

To simplify this process, we've included a tool for verifying if a token has an attestation on the target chain. This tool uses the [`wrappedAsset`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/6130bbb6f456b42b789a71f7ea2fd049d632d2fb/ethereum/contracts/bridge/BridgeGetters.sol#L50-L52){target=\_blank} function from the `TokenBridge` contract. If the token has an attestation, the `wrappedAsset` function returns the address of the wrapped token on the target chain; otherwise, it returns the zero address.

???- tip "Check Token Attestation"
    1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-cross-chain-token-transfer){target=\_blank} and navigate to the project directory:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-cross-chain-token-transfer.git
        cd cross-chain-token-transfers
        ```
    2. Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    
    3. Run the script to check token attestation:
        ```bash
        npm run verify
        ```

    4. Follow the prompts:

        1. Enter the RPC URL of the target chain
        2. Enter the `TokenBridge` contract address on the target chain
        3. Enter the token contract address on the source chain
        4. Enter the source chain ID

    5. The expected output when the token has an attestation:
        
        <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npm run verify</span>
	<span data-ty> > cross-chain-token-transfer@1.0.0 verify</span>
	<span data-ty> > npx ts-node script/check-attestation.ts</span>
  <span data-ty> </span>
	<span data-ty> Enter the TARGET chain RPC URL: https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org</span>
	<span data-ty> Enter the Token Bridge contract address on the TARGET chain: 0x05...E153</span>
  <span data-ty> Enter the token contract address on the SOURCE chain: 0x54...bc65</span>
  <span data-ty> Enter the SOURCE chain ID: 6</span>
  <span data-ty> The token is attested on the target chain. Wrapped token address: 0xDDB349c976cA2C873644F21f594767Eb5390C831</span>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>
    
    Using this tool ensures that you only attempt to transfer tokens with verified attestations, avoiding any potential issues during the cross-chain transfer process.

## Project Setup

Let's start by initializing a new Foundry project. This will set up a basic structure for our smart contracts.

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to initialize a new Foundry project:
    
    ```bash
    forge init cross-chain-token-transfers
    ```

    This will create a new directory named `cross-chain-token-transfers` with a basic project structure. This also initializes a new `git` repository.

2. Navigate into the newly created project directory:

    ```bash
    cd cross-chain-token-transfers
    ```

3. Install the Wormhole Solidity SDK:

    ```bash
    forge install wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk
    ```

    To ease development, we'll use the Wormhole Solidity SDK, which provides useful helpers for cross-chain development.
    This SDK includes the `TokenSender` and `TokenReceiver` abstract classes, which simplify sending and receiving tokens across chains.

## Build Cross-Chain Contracts

In this section, we'll build two smart contracts to send tokens from a source chain and receive them on a target chain. These contracts will interact with the Wormhole protocol to facilitate secure and seamless cross-chain token transfers.

At a high level, our contracts will:

1. Send tokens from one blockchain to another using the Wormhole protocol
2. Receive and process the tokens on the target chain, ensuring they are correctly transferred to the intended recipient

Before diving into the contract implementation steps, let’s first break down the key parts of the contracts.

### Sender Contract: CrossChainSender

The `CrossChainSender` contract calculates the cost of sending tokens across chains and then facilitates the actual token transfer.

Let's start writing the `CrossChainSender` contract:

1. Create a new file named `CrossChainSender.sol` in the `/src` directory:
    
    ```bash
    touch src/CrossChainSender.sol
    ```

2. Open the file. First, we'll start with the imports and the contract setup:

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol";
import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol";

contract CrossChainSender is TokenSender {
    uint256 constant GAS_LIMIT = 250_000;

    constructor(
        address _wormholeRelayer,
        address _tokenBridge,
        address _wormhole
    ) TokenBase(_wormholeRelayer, _tokenBridge, _wormhole) {}
    ```

    This sets up the basic structure of the contract, including the necessary imports and the constructor that initializes the contract with the Wormhole-related addresses.

3. Next, let's add a function that estimates the cost of sending tokens across chains:

    ```solidity
    uint16 targetChain
    ) public view returns (uint256 cost) {
        uint256 deliveryCost;
        (deliveryCost, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
            targetChain,
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT
        );

        cost = deliveryCost + wormhole.messageFee();
    }
    ```

    This function, `quoteCrossChainDeposit`, helps calculate the cost of transferring tokens to a different chain. It factors in the delivery cost and the cost of publishing a message via the Wormhole protocol.

4. Finally, we'll add the function that sends the tokens across chains:

    ```solidity
    uint16 targetChain,
        address targetReceiver,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        address token
    ) public payable {
        uint256 cost = quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain);
        require(
            msg.value == cost,
            "msg.value must equal quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain)"
        );

        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        bytes memory payload = abi.encode(recipient);

        sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm(
            targetChain,
            targetReceiver,
            payload,
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT,
            token,
            amount
        );
    }
}
    ```

    This `sendCrossChainDeposit` function is where the actual token transfer happens. It sends the tokens to the recipient on the target chain using the Wormhole protocol.

Here’s a breakdown of what happens in each step of the `sendCrossChainDeposit` function:

1. **Cost calculation** - the function starts by calculating the cost of the cross-chain transfer using `quoteCrossChainDeposit`(`targetChain`). This cost includes both the delivery fee and the Wormhole message fee. The `sendCrossChainDeposit` function then checks that the user has sent the correct amount of Ether to cover this cost (`msg.value`)

2. **Token transfer to contract** - the next step is to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the user to the contract itself using `IERC-20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount)`. This ensures that the contract has custody of the tokens before initiating the cross-chain transfer

3. **Payload encoding** - The recipient's address on the target chain is encoded into a payload using `abi.encode(recipient)`. This payload will be sent along with the token transfer, so the target contract knows who should receive the tokens on the destination chain

4. **Cross-chain transfer** - the `sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm` function is called to initiate the cross-chain token transfer. This function:
    - Specifies the `targetChain` (the Wormhole chain ID of the destination blockchain).
    - Sends the `targetReceiver` contract address on the target chain that will receive the tokens.
    - Attaches the payload containing the recipient's address.
    - Sets the `GAS_LIMIT` for the transaction.
    - Passes the token `address` and `amount` to transfer.

    This triggers the Wormhole protocol to handle the cross-chain messaging and token transfer, ensuring the tokens and payload reach the correct destination on the target chain.

You can find the complete code for the `CrossChainSender.sol` below.

??? code "MessageSender.sol"

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol";
import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol";

contract CrossChainSender is TokenSender {
    uint256 constant GAS_LIMIT = 250_000;

    constructor(
        address _wormholeRelayer,
        address _tokenBridge,
        address _wormhole
    ) TokenBase(_wormholeRelayer, _tokenBridge, _wormhole) {}

    // Function to get the estimated cost for cross-chain deposit
    function quoteCrossChainDeposit(
        uint16 targetChain
    ) public view returns (uint256 cost) {
        uint256 deliveryCost;
        (deliveryCost, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
            targetChain,
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT
        );

        cost = deliveryCost + wormhole.messageFee();
    }

    // Function to send tokens and payload across chains
    function sendCrossChainDeposit(
        uint16 targetChain,
        address targetReceiver,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        address token
    ) public payable {
        uint256 cost = quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain);
        require(
            msg.value == cost,
            "msg.value must equal quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain)"
        );

        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        bytes memory payload = abi.encode(recipient);

        sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm(
            targetChain,
            targetReceiver,
            payload,
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT,
            token,
            amount
        );
    }
}
    ```

### Receiver Contract: CrossChainReceiver

The `CrossChainReceiver` contract is designed to handle the receipt of tokens and payloads from another blockchain. It ensures that the tokens are correctly transferred to the designated recipient on the receiving chain.

Let's start writing the `CrossChainReceiver` contract:

1. Create a new file named `CrossChainReceiver.sol` in the `/src` directory:

    ```bash
    touch src/CrossChainReceiver.sol
    ```

2. Open the file. First, we'll start with the imports and the contract setup:

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol";
import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol";

contract CrossChainReceiver is TokenReceiver {
    // The Wormhole relayer and registeredSenders are inherited from the Base.sol contract

    constructor(
        address _wormholeRelayer,
        address _tokenBridge,
        address _wormhole
    ) TokenBase(_wormholeRelayer, _tokenBridge, _wormhole) {}
    ```

    Similar to the `CrossChainSender` contract, this sets up the basic structure of the contract, including the necessary imports and the constructor that initializes the contract with the Wormhole-related addresses.

3. Next, let's add a function to handle receiving the payload and tokens:

    ```solidity
    bytes memory payload,
        TokenReceived[] memory receivedTokens,
        bytes32 sourceAddress,
        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32 // deliveryHash
    )
        internal
        override
        onlyWormholeRelayer
        isRegisteredSender(sourceChain, sourceAddress)
    {
        require(receivedTokens.length == 1, "Expected 1 token transfer");

        // Decode the recipient address from the payload
        address recipient = abi.decode(payload, (address));

        // Transfer the received tokens to the intended recipient
        IERC20(receivedTokens[0].tokenAddress).transfer(
            recipient,
            receivedTokens[0].amount
        );
    }
}
    ```

    This `receivePayloadAndTokens` function processes the tokens and payload sent from another chain, decodes the recipient address, and transfers the tokens to them using the Wormhole protocol. This function also validates the emitter (`sourceAddress`) to ensure the message comes from a trusted sender.

    This function ensures that:

    - It only processes one token transfer at a time
    - The `sourceAddress` is checked against a list of registered senders using the `isRegisteredSender` modifier, which verifies if the emitter is allowed to send tokens to this contract
    - The recipient address is decoded from the payload, and the received tokens are transferred to them using the ERC-20 interface

After we call `sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm` on the source chain, the message goes through the standard Wormhole message lifecycle. Once a [VAA (Verifiable Action Approval)](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} is available, the delivery provider will call `receivePayloadAndTokens` on the target chain and target address specified, with the appropriate inputs.

??? tip "Understanding the `TokenReceived` Struct"

    Let’s delve into the fields provided to us in the `TokenReceived` struct:

    ```solidity
    struct TokenReceived {
    bytes32 tokenHomeAddress;
    uint16 tokenHomeChain;
    address tokenAddress;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 amountNormalized;
}
    ```

    - **`tokenHomeAddress`** - the original address of the token on its native chain. This is the same as the token field in the call to `sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm` unless the original token sent is a Wormhole-wrapped token. In that case, this will be the address of the original version of the token (on its native chain) in Wormhole address format (left-padded with 12 zeros)

    - **`tokenHomeChain`** - the Wormhole chain ID corresponding to the home address above. This will typically be the source chain unless the original token sent is a Wormhole-wrapped asset, which will be the chain of the unwrapped version of the token

    - **`tokenAddress`** - the address of the IERC-20 token on the target chain that has been transferred to this contract. If `tokenHomeChain` equals the target chain, this will be the same as `tokenHomeAddress`; otherwise, it will be the Wormhole-wrapped version of the token sent

    - **`amount`** - the token amount sent to you with the same units as the original token. Since `TokenBridge` only sends with eight decimals of precision, if your token has 18 decimals, this will be the "amount" you sent, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10^10

    - **`amountNormalized`** - the amount of token divided by (1 if decimals ≤ 8, else 10^(decimals - 8))

You can find the complete code for the `CrossChainReceiver.sol` contract below:

contract CrossChainReceiver is TokenReceiver {
    // The Wormhole relayer and registeredSenders are inherited from the Base.sol contract

    constructor(
        address _wormholeRelayer,
        address _tokenBridge,
        address _wormhole
    ) TokenBase(_wormholeRelayer, _tokenBridge, _wormhole) {}

    // Function to receive the cross-chain payload and tokens with emitter validation
    function receivePayloadAndTokens(
        bytes memory payload,
        TokenReceived[] memory receivedTokens,
        bytes32 sourceAddress,
        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32 // deliveryHash
    )
        internal
        override
        onlyWormholeRelayer
        isRegisteredSender(sourceChain, sourceAddress)
    {
        require(receivedTokens.length == 1, "Expected 1 token transfer");

        // Decode the recipient address from the payload
        address recipient = abi.decode(payload, (address));

        // Transfer the received tokens to the intended recipient
        IERC20(receivedTokens[0].tokenAddress).transfer(
            recipient,
            receivedTokens[0].amount
        );
    }
}
    ```

## Deploy the Contracts

Now that you've written the `CrossChainSender` and `CrossChainReceiver` contracts, it's time to deploy them to your chosen networks.

1. **Set up deployment configuration** - before deploying, you must configure the networks and the deployment environment. This information is stored in a configuration file

    1. Create a directory named deploy-config in the root of your project:

        ```bash
        mkdir deploy-config
        ```

    2. Create a `config.json` file in the `deploy-config` directory:

        ```bash
        touch deploy-config/config.json
        ```

    3. Open the `config.json` file and add the following configuration:

        ```json
        {
    "chains": [
        {
            "description": "Avalanche testnet fuji",
            "chainId": 6,
            "rpc": "https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc",
            "tokenBridge": "0x61E44E506Ca5659E6c0bba9b678586fA2d729756",
            "wormholeRelayer": "0xA3cF45939bD6260bcFe3D66bc73d60f19e49a8BB",
            "wormhole": "0x7bbcE28e64B3F8b84d876Ab298393c38ad7aac4C"
        },
        {
            "description": "Celo Testnet",
            "chainId": 14,
            "rpc": "https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org",
            "tokenBridge": "0x05ca6037eC51F8b712eD2E6Fa72219FEaE74E153",
            "wormholeRelayer": "0x306B68267Deb7c5DfCDa3619E22E9Ca39C374f84",
            "wormhole": "0x88505117CA88e7dd2eC6EA1E13f0948db2D50D56"
        }
    ]
}
        ```

        This file specifies the details for each chain where you plan to deploy your contracts, including the RPC URL, the `TokenBridge` address, the Wormhole relayer, and the Wormhole Core Contract.

        For a complete list of Wormhole contract addresses on various blockchains, refer to the [Wormhole Contract Addresses](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/){target=_blank}.

        !!! note
            You can add your desired chains to this file by specifying the required fields for each chain. In this example, we use the Avalanche Fuji and Celo Alfajores Testnets.

    4. Create a `contracts.json` file in the `deploy-config` directory:

        ```bash
        echo '{}' > deploy-config/contracts.json
        ```

        This file can be left blank initially. It will be automatically updated with the deployed contract addresses after a successful deployment

2. **Set up your Node.js environment** - you'll need to set up your Node.js environment to run the deployment script

    1. Initialize a Node.js project:

        ```bash
        npm init -y
        ```
    
    2. Install the necessary dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install ethers dotenv readline-sync @types/readline-sync
        ```

        These dependencies are required for the deployment script to work properly.

3. **Compile your smart contracts** - compile your smart contracts using Foundry. This ensures that your contracts are up-to-date and ready for deployment

    - Run the following command to compile your contracts:

        ```bash
        forge build
        ```

        This will generate the necessary ABI and bytecode files in a directory named `/out`.

    The expected output should be similar to this:

    <div id="termynal" data-termynal>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>forge build</span>
	<span data-ty> > [⠒] Compiling...</span>
	<span data-ty> > [⠰] Compiling 30 files with 0.8.23</span>
	<span data-ty> [⠔] Solc 0.8.23 finished in 2.29s</span>
	<span data-ty>Compiler run successful!</span>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

4. **Write the deployment script** - you’ll need a script to automate the deployment of your contracts. Let’s create the deployment script

    1. Create a new file named `deploy.ts` in the `/script` directory:

        ```bash
        touch script/deploy.ts
        ```

    2. Open the file and load imports and configuration:

        ```typescript
        import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import readlineSync from 'readline-sync';

dotenv.config();
        ```

        Import the required libraries and modules to interact with Ethereum, handle file paths, load environment variables, and enable user interaction via the terminal.

    3. Define interfaces to use for chain configuration and contract deployment:

        ```typescript
        description: string;
  chainId: number;
  rpc: string;
  tokenBridge: string;
  wormholeRelayer: string;
  wormhole: string;
}

interface DeployedContracts {
  [chainId: number]: {
    networkName: string;
    CrossChainSender?: string;
    CrossChainReceiver?: string;
    deployedAt: string;
  };
}
        ```

        These interfaces define the structure of the chain configuration and the contract deployment details.

    4. Load and select the chains for deployment:

        ```typescript
        const configPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../deploy-config/config.json');
  return JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(configPath, 'utf8')).chains;
}

function selectChain(
  chains: ChainConfig[],
  role: 'source' | 'target'
): ChainConfig {
  console.log(`\nSelect the ${role.toUpperCase()} chain:`);
  chains.forEach((chain, index) => {
    console.log(`${index + 1}: ${chain.description}`);
  });

  const chainIndex =
    readlineSync.questionInt(
      `\nEnter the number for the ${role.toUpperCase()} chain: `
    ) - 1;
  return chains[chainIndex];
}
        ```

        The `loadConfig` function reads the chain configuration from the `config.json` file, and the `selectChain` function allows the user to choose the source and target chains for deployment interactively. The user is prompted in the terminal to select which chains to use, making the process interactive and user-friendly.

    5. Define the main function for deployment and load the chain configuration:

        ```typescript
        const chains = loadConfig();

  const sourceChain = selectChain(chains, 'source');
  const targetChain = selectChain(chains, 'target');
        ```

        - The `main` function is the entry point for the deployment script
        - We then call the `loadConfig` function we previously defined to load the chain configuration from the `config.json` file

    6. Set up provider and wallet: 
    
        ```typescript
        const targetProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(targetChain.rpc);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, sourceProvider);
        ```
        
        The scripts establish a connection to the blockchain using a provider and create a wallet instance using a private key. This wallet is responsible for signing the deployment transaction on the source chain.

    7. Read the compiled contracts:

        ```typescript
        fs.readFileSync(
      path.resolve(
        __dirname,
        '../out/CrossChainSender.sol/CrossChainSender.json'
      ),
      'utf8'
    )
  );
        ```

        - This code reads the `CrossChainSender.json` file, the compiled output of the `CrossChainSender.sol` contract
        - The file is in the `../out/` directory, which contains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and bytecode generated during contract compilation
        - It uses the `fs.readFileSync` function to read the file and `JSON.parse` to convert the file contents (in JSON format) into a JavaScript object

    8. Extract the contract ABI and bytecode:

        ```typescript
        const bytecode = senderJson.bytecode;
        ```

        - **ABI (Application Binary Interface)** - defines the structure of the contract’s functions, events, and data types, allowing the front end to interact with the contract on the blockchain
        - **Bytecode** - this is the compiled machine code that will be deployed to the blockchain to create the contract

    9. Create the Contract Factory:

        ```typescript
        abi,
    bytecode,
    wallet
  );
        ```

        - **`ethers.ContractFactory`** - creates a new contract factory using the ABI, bytecode, and a wallet (representing the signer). The contract factory is responsible for deploying instances of the contract to the blockchain
        - This is a crucial step for deploying the contract since the factory will create and deploy the `CrossChainSender` contract

    10. Deploy the `CrossChainSender` and `CrossChainReceiver` contracts:

        === "`CrossChainSender`"
            ```typescript
            const senderContract = await CrossChainSenderFactory.deploy(
      sourceChain.wormholeRelayer,
      sourceChain.tokenBridge,
      sourceChain.wormhole
    );
    await senderContract.waitForDeployment();
            ```

        === "`CrossChainReceiver`"
            ```typescript
            process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!,
      targetProvider
    );
    const receiverJson = JSON.parse(
      fs.readFileSync(
        path.resolve(
          __dirname,
          '../out/CrossChainReceiver.sol/CrossChainReceiver.json'
        ),
        'utf8'
      )
    );
    const CrossChainReceiverFactory = new ethers.ContractFactory(
      receiverJson.abi,
      receiverJson.bytecode,
      targetWallet
    );

    const receiverContract = await CrossChainReceiverFactory.deploy(
      targetChain.wormholeRelayer,
      targetChain.tokenBridge,
      targetChain.wormhole
    );
    await receiverContract.waitForDeployment();
            ```

        Both functions deploy the respective contracts to the selected chains.

        For the `CrossChainReceiver` contract:

        - It defines the wallet related to the target chain
        - The logic reads the compiled ABI and bytecode from the JSON file generated during compilation
        - It creates a new contract factory using the ABI, bytecode, and wallet
        - It deploys the contract to the selected chain passing in the Wormhole Relayer, `TokenBridge`, and Wormhole addresses

    11. Save the deployed contract addresses:

        === "`senderAddress`"
            ```typescript
            console.log(
      `CrossChainSender on ${sourceChain.description}: ${senderAddress}`
    );
            ```

        === "`receiverAddress`"
            ```typescript
            console.log(
      `CrossChainReceiver on ${targetChain.description}: ${receiverAddress}`
    );
            ```

        You may display the deployed contract addresses in the terminal or save them to a JSON file for future reference.

    12. Register the `CrossChainSender` address on the target chain:

        ```typescript
        receiverAddress,
      receiverJson.abi,
      targetWallet
    );

    const tx = await CrossChainReceiverContract.setRegisteredSender(
      sourceChain.chainId,
      ethers.zeroPadValue(senderAddress as BytesLike, 32)
    );

    await tx.wait();
        ```

        After you deploy the `CrossChainReceiver` contract on the target network, the sender contract address from the source chain needs to be registered. This ensures that only messages from the registered `CrossChainSender` contract are processed.

        This additional step is essential to enforce emitter validation, preventing unauthorized senders from delivering messages to the `CrossChainReceiver` contract.

    13. Save the deployment details:

        ???- example "Save Deployment Details Example"
            ```typescript
            __dirname,
      '../deploy-config/contracts.json'
    );
    let deployedContracts: DeployedContracts = {};

    if (fs.existsSync(deployedContractsPath)) {
      deployedContracts = JSON.parse(
        fs.readFileSync(deployedContractsPath, 'utf8')
      );
    }

    // Update the contracts.json file:
    // If a contract already exists on a chain, update its address; otherwise, add a new entry.
    if (!deployedContracts[sourceChain.chainId]) {
      deployedContracts[sourceChain.chainId] = {
        networkName: sourceChain.description,
        deployedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      };
    }
    deployedContracts[sourceChain.chainId].CrossChainSender =
      senderAddress.toString();
    deployedContracts[sourceChain.chainId].deployedAt =
      new Date().toISOString();

    if (!deployedContracts[targetChain.chainId]) {
      deployedContracts[targetChain.chainId] = {
        networkName: targetChain.description,
        deployedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      };
    }
    deployedContracts[targetChain.chainId].CrossChainReceiver =
      receiverAddress.toString();
    deployedContracts[targetChain.chainId].deployedAt =
      new Date().toISOString();

    // Save the updated contracts.json file
    fs.writeFileSync(
      deployedContractsPath,
      JSON.stringify(deployedContracts, null, 2)
    );
            ```
        
        Add your desired logic to save the deployed contract addresses in a JSON file (or another format). This will be important later when transferring tokens, as you'll need these addresses to interact with the deployed contracts.

    14. Handle errors and finalize the script:

        ```typescript
        if (error.code === 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS') {
      console.error(
        'Error: Insufficient funds for deployment. Please make sure your wallet has enough funds to cover the gas fees.'
      );
    } else {
      console.error('An unexpected error occurred:', error.message);
    }
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
});
        ```

        The try-catch block wraps the deployment logic to catch any errors that may occur.

        - If the error is due to insufficient funds, it logs a clear message about needing more gas fees
        - For any other errors, it logs the specific error message to help with debugging

        The `process.exit(1)` ensures that the script exits with a failure status code if any error occurs.

        ```

5. **Add your private key** - you'll need to provide your private key. It allows your deployment script to sign the transactions that deploy the smart contracts to the blockchain. Without it, the script won't be able to interact with the blockchain on your behalf

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your private key:

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    Inside `.env`, add your private key in the following format:

    ```env
    PRIVATE_KEY=INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY
    ```
    
6. **Run the deployment script**

    1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

        ```bash
        npx ts-node script/deploy.ts
        ```

        This will execute the deployment script, deploying both contracts to the selected chains.

    2. Check the deployment output:

        - You will see the deployed contract addresses printed in the terminal if successful. The `contracts.json` file will be updated with these addresses
        - If you encounter an error, the script will provide feedback, such as insufficient funds for gas

If you followed the logic provided in the full code above, your terminal output should look something like this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx ts-node deploy.ts</span>
	<span data-ty> > cross-chain-token-transfer@1.0.0 deploy</span>
	<span data-ty> > npx ts-node script/deploy.ts</span>
	<span data-ty> Select the SOURCE chain:</span>
	<span data-ty> 1: Avalanche testnet fuji</span>
  <span data-ty> 2: Celo Testnet</span>

  <span data-ty> </span>
  <span data-ty> Select the TARGET chain:</span>
  <span data-ty> 1: Avalanche testnet fuji</span>
  <span data-ty> 2: Celo Testnet</span>
  <span data-ty> </span>

## Transfer Tokens Across Chains

### Quick Recap

Up to this point, you've set up a new Solidity project using Foundry, developed two key contracts (`CrossChainSender` and `CrossChainReceiver`), and created a deployment script to deploy these contracts to different blockchain networks. The deployment script also saves the new contract addresses for easy reference. With everything in place, it's time to transfer tokens using the deployed contracts.

In this step, you'll write a script to transfer tokens across chains using the `CrossChainSender` and `CrossChainReceiver` contracts you deployed earlier. This script will interact with the contracts and facilitate the cross-chain token transfer.

### Transfer Script

1. **Set up the transfer script**

    1. Create a new file named `transfer.ts` in the `/script` directory:

        ```bash
        touch script/transfer.ts
        ```

    2. Open the file. Start with the necessary imports, interfaces and configurations:

        ```typescript
        import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import readlineSync from 'readline-sync';

dotenv.config();

interface ChainConfig {
  description: string;
  chainId: number;
  rpc: string;
  tokenBridge: string;
  wormholeRelayer: string;
  wormhole: string;
}

interface DeployedContracts {
  [chainId: number]: {
    networkName: string;
    CrossChainSender?: string;
    CrossChainReceiver?: string;
    deployedAt: string;
  };
}
        ```

        These imports include the essential libraries for interacting with Ethereum, handling file paths, loading environment variables, and managing user input.

    3. Load configuration and contracts:


        ```typescript
        const configPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../deploy-config/config.json');
  return JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(configPath, 'utf8')).chains;
}

function loadDeployedContracts(): DeployedContracts {
  const contractsPath = path.resolve(
    __dirname,
    '../deploy-config/contracts.json'
  );
  if (
    !fs.existsSync(contractsPath) ||
    fs.readFileSync(contractsPath, 'utf8').trim() === ''
  ) {
    console.error(
      'No contracts found. Please deploy contracts first before transferring tokens.'
    );
    process.exit(1);
  }
  return JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(contractsPath, 'utf8'));
}
        ```

        These functions load the network and contract details that were saved during deployment.

    4. Allow users to select source and target chains:

        Refer to the deployed contracts and create logic as desired. In our example, we made this process interactive, allowing users to select the source and target chains from all the historically deployed contracts. This interactive approach helps ensure the correct chains are selected for the token transfer.

        ```typescript
        chainId: number;
  networkName: string;
} {
  const sourceOptions = Object.entries(deployedContracts).filter(
    ([, contracts]) => contracts.CrossChainSender
  );

  if (sourceOptions.length === 0) {
    console.error('No source chains available with CrossChainSender deployed.');
    process.exit(1);
  }

  console.log('\nSelect the source chain:');
  sourceOptions.forEach(([chainId, contracts], index) => {
    console.log(`${index + 1}: ${contracts.networkName}`);
  });

  const selectedIndex =
    readlineSync.questionInt(`\nEnter the number for the source chain: `) - 1;
  return {
    chainId: Number(sourceOptions[selectedIndex][0]),
    networkName: sourceOptions[selectedIndex][1].networkName,
  };
}

function selectTargetChain(deployedContracts: DeployedContracts): {
  chainId: number;
  networkName: string;
} {
  const targetOptions = Object.entries(deployedContracts).filter(
    ([, contracts]) => contracts.CrossChainReceiver
  );

  if (targetOptions.length === 0) {
    console.error(
      'No target chains available with CrossChainReceiver deployed.'
    );
    process.exit(1);
  }

  console.log('\nSelect the target chain:');
  targetOptions.forEach(([chainId, contracts], index) => {
    console.log(`${index + 1}: ${contracts.networkName}`);
  });

  const selectedIndex =
    readlineSync.questionInt(`\nEnter the number for the target chain: `) - 1;
  return {
    chainId: Number(targetOptions[selectedIndex][0]),
    networkName: targetOptions[selectedIndex][1].networkName,
  };
}
        ```

2. **Implement the token transfer logic**

    1. Start the `main` function:
    
        ```typescript
        const chains = loadConfig();
  const deployedContracts = loadDeployedContracts();

  // Select the source chain (only show chains with CrossChainSender deployed)
  const { chainId: sourceChainId, networkName: sourceNetworkName } =
    selectSourceChain(deployedContracts);
  const sourceChain = chains.find((chain) => chain.chainId === sourceChainId)!;

  // Select the target chain (only show chains with CrossChainReceiver deployed)
  const { chainId: targetChainId, networkName: targetNetworkName } =
    selectTargetChain(deployedContracts);
  const targetChain = chains.find((chain) => chain.chainId === targetChainId)!;

  // Set up providers and wallets
  const sourceProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(sourceChain.rpc);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!, sourceProvider);

  // Load the ABI from the JSON file (use the compiled ABI from Forge or Hardhat)
  const CrossChainSenderArtifact = JSON.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(
      path.resolve(
        __dirname,
        '../out/CrossChainSender.sol/CrossChainSender.json'
      ),
      'utf8'
    )
  );

  const abi = CrossChainSenderArtifact.abi;

  // Create the contract instance using the full ABI
  const CrossChainSender = new ethers.Contract(
    deployedContracts[sourceChainId].CrossChainSender!,
    abi,
    wallet
  );
        ```
    
        The `main` function is where the token transfer logic will reside. It loads the chain and contract details, sets up the wallet and provider, and loads the `CrossChainSender` contract.

    2. Ask the user for token transfer details:

        You'll now ask the user for the token contract address, the recipient address on the target chain, and the amount of tokens to transfer.

        ```typescript
        'Enter the token contract address: '
  );
  const recipientAddress = readlineSync.question(
    'Enter the recipient address on the target chain: '
  );

  // Get the token contract
  const tokenContractDecimals = new ethers.Contract(
    tokenAddress,
    [
      'function decimals() view returns (uint8)',
      'function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)',
    ],
    wallet
  );

  // Fetch the token decimals
  const decimals = await tokenContractDecimals.decimals();

  // Get the amount from the user, then parse it according to the token's decimals
  const amount = ethers.parseUnits(
    readlineSync.question('Enter the amount of tokens to transfer: '),
    decimals
  );
        ```

        This section of the script prompts the user for the token contract address and the recipient's address, fetches the token's decimal value, and parses the amount accordingly.

    3. Initiate the transfer:

        Finally, initiate the cross-chain transfer and log the details.

        ```typescript
        // Approve the CrossChainSender contract to transfer tokens on behalf of the user
  const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(
    tokenAddress,
    ['function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)'],
    wallet
  );

  const approveTx = await tokenContract.approve(
    deployedContracts[sourceChainId].CrossChainSender!,
    amount
  );
  await approveTx.wait();
  console.log(`Approved tokens for cross-chain transfer.`);

  // Initiate the cross-chain transfer
  const transferTx = await CrossChainSender.sendCrossChainDeposit(
    targetChainId,
    deployedContracts[targetChainId].CrossChainReceiver!,
    recipientAddress,
    amount,
    tokenAddress,
    { value: cost } // Attach the necessary fee for cross-chain transfer
  );
  await transferTx.wait();
  console.log(
    `Transfer initiated from ${sourceNetworkName} to ${targetNetworkName}. Transaction Hash: ${transferTx.hash}`
  );
}
        ```

        This part of the script first approves the token transfer, then initiates the cross-chain transfer using the `CrossChainSender` contract, and finally logs the transaction hash for the user to track.

    4. Finalize the script:

        ```typescript
        console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
});
        ```

        This section finalizes the script by calling the `main` function and handling any errors that may occur during the token transfer process.

  process.exit(1);
});
    ```

### Transfer Tokens

Now that your transfer script is ready, it’s time to execute it and perform a cross-chain token transfer.

1. **Run the transfer script**

    Open your terminal and run the transfer script:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node script/transfer.ts
    ```

    This command will start the script, prompting you to select the source and target chains, input the token address, recipient address, and the amount of tokens to transfer.

2. **Follow the prompts** - the script will guide you through selecting the source and target chains and entering the necessary details for the token transfer. Once you provide all the required information, the script will initiate the token transfer

3. **Verify the transaction** - after running the script, you should see a confirmation message with the transaction hash. You can use this transaction hash to check the transfer status on the respective blockchain explorers

You can verify the transaction on the [Wormhole Explorer](https://wormholescan.io/){target=\_balnk} using the link provided in the terminal output. This explorer also offers the option to add the transferred token to your MetaMask wallet automatically.

If you followed the logic provided in the `transfer.ts` file above, your terminal output should look something like this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx ts-node transfer.ts</span>
	<span data-ty> > cross-chain-token-transfer@1.0.0 transfer</span>
	<span data-ty> > npx ts-node script/transfer.ts</span>
  <span data-ty> </span>
	<span data-ty> Select the source chain:</span>
	<span data-ty> 1: Avalanche testnet fuji</span>
  <span data-ty> 2: Celo Testnet</span>
  <span data-ty> </span>
  <span data-ty> Enter the number for the SOURCE chain: 1</span>
  <span data-ty> </span>
  <span data-ty> Select the target chain:</span>
  <span data-ty> 1: Avalanche testnet fuji</span>
  <span data-ty> 2: Celo Testnet</span>
  <span data-ty> </span>
  <span data-ty> Enter the number for the TARGET chain: 2</span>
  <span data-ty> </span>
  <span data-ty> Initiating transfer from Avalanche testnet fuji to Celo Testnet</span>
  <span data-ty> Enter the token contract address: 0x5425890298aed601595a70ab815c96711a31bc65</span>
  <span data-ty> Enter the recipient address on the target chain: INSERT_YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS</span>
  <span data-ty> Enter the amount of tokens to transfer: 2</span>
  <span data-ty> Approved tokens for cross-chain transfer.</span>
  <span data-ty> Transfer initiated from Avalanche testnet fuji to Celo Testnet. Transaction Hash: 0x4a923975d955c1f226a1c2f61a1a0fa1ab1a9e229dc29ceaeadf8ef40acd071f</span>
	<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

!!! note
    In this example, we demonstrated a token transfer from the Avalanche Fuji Testnet to the Celo Alfajores Testnet. We sent two units of USDC Testnet tokens using the token contract address `0x5425890298aed601595a70ab815c96711a31bc65`. You can replace these details with those relevant to your project or use the same for testing purposes.

# Create Multichain Tokens

## Introduction

Blockchain ecosystems are becoming increasingly interconnected, with assets often needing to exist across multiple networks to maximize their utility and reach. For example, tokens created on one chain may want to expand to others to tap into broader audiences and liquidity pools.

This guide explains how to create a multichain token—a token that seamlessly bridges across blockchains using the Wormhole protocol. The process is designed to be user-friendly. With just a few steps, your token can become multichain, enabling it to be traded or used on various networks.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn:

- How to register your token for bridging
- How to create a wrapped version of your token
- How to ensure its visibility on blockchain explorers

Let’s begin with a straightforward, step-by-step process for creating a multichain token and expanding its reach.

## Register the Token on the Source Chain

The first step in creating a multichain token is registering your token on its source chain. This ensures the token is prepared for bridging across blockchains. Follow these steps:

1. Open the [Portal Bridge](https://portalbridge.com/advanced-tools/#/register){target=\_blank}
2. Select the blockchain where your token is currently deployed (source chain)
3. Connect your wallet by following the on-screen instructions
4. Locate the **Asset** field and paste the token contract address
5. Click **Next** to proceed

<img src="/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/native-token-transfers/multichain-tokens/multichain-token-1.webp" alt="Source Chain Registration Screen">

## Register the Token on the Target Chain

After registering your token on the source chain, the next step is to select the target chain—the blockchain where you want the wrapped version of your token to exist. This step connects your token to its destination network.

1. Choose the blockchain where you want the token to be bridged (target chain)
2. Connect your wallet to the target chain
3. Click **Next** to finalize the registration process

<img src="/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/native-token-transfers/multichain-tokens/multichain-token-2.webp" alt="Target Chain Registration Screen">

## Send an Attestation
Attestation is a key step in the process. It verifies your token’s metadata, ensuring it is correctly recognized on the target chain’s blockchain explorer (e.g., [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/){target=\_blank}).

1. Click **Attest** to initiate the attestation process
2. Approve the transaction in your wallet when prompted

<img src="/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/native-token-transfers/multichain-tokens/multichain-token-3.webp" alt="Send Attestation Screen">

!!! note
    - Attestation is crucial for token metadata to appear correctly on blockchain explorers like Etherscan, allowing users to identify and trust your token
    - Ensure you have sufficient funds to cover transaction fees on the target chain

## Create the Wrapped Token

The final step is to create the wrapped token on the target chain. This token represents the original asset and enables its use within the target blockchain.

1. Click **Create** to generate the wrapped token
2. Approve the transaction in your wallet when prompted

<img src="/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/native-token-transfers/multichain-tokens/multichain-token-4.webp" alt="Create Wrapped Token Screen">

Upon successful creation, you will see a confirmation screen displaying key details such as the source chain, target chain, and transaction status. This helps verify that the process was completed correctly. Refer to the image below as an example:

<img src="/docs/images/tutorials/by-product/native-token-transfers/multichain-tokens/multichain-token-5.webp" alt="Confirmation Screen">

## Additional Steps and Recommendations

After creating your multichain token, there are a few optional but highly recommended steps to ensure the best experience for users interacting with your token.

### Add Your Token to the Wormhole Metadata List (Legacy)

For legacy compatibility in the [**Advanced Tools**](https://portalbridge.com/advanced-tools/){target=\_blank} section of Portal Bridge, you can request updates to your token metadata. Follow these steps:

1. Join the [Wormhole Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wormholecrypto){target=\_blank}
2. Submit a request for metadata updates in the appropriate support channel

!!! note
    These updates only apply to the **Advanced Tools** section of Portal Bridge and will not update how your token appears in other Wormhole-powered apps or on blockchain explorers like Etherscan.

### Update Metadata on Blockchain Explorers

It is recommended that you update your token’s metadata on blockchain explorers such as Etherscan. This includes adding details like the token logo, price, and contract verification.

1. Create an account on the relevant scanner and go to the [token update section](https://etherscan.io/tokenupdate){target=\_blank} (or the relevant scanner that you would like to update metadata on)
2. Copy and paste the wrapped contract address in the **Token Update Application Form**
3. Before proceeding to the next step, you will need to verify as the contract address owner on [Etherscan’s address verification tool](https://etherscan.io/verifyAddress/){target=\_blank}
4. Follow the directions to verify contract address ownership via MetaMask by reviewing the [guide on verifying address ownership](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-verify-address-ownership/){target=\_blank}
   - Given that Wormhole may be the contract owner, use the manual verification process by reaching out through the [Etherscan contact form](https://etherscan.io/contactus){target=\_blank}. The team will provide support as needed
5. Once the step above is completed, follow the [instructions to update token information](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-update-token-information-on-token-page/){target=\_blank}

# Cross-Chain treasury management proposal

This guide walks through the process of creating and executing a cross-chain governance proposal to mint W tokens to both the Optimism and Arbitrum treasuries. In this tutorial, we'll cover how to create a proposal on the hub chain (Ethereum Mainnet), cast votes from spoke chains (Optimism and Arbitrum), aggregate votes, and execute the proposal.

## Create a Proposal

The first step is to create a proposal on the hub chain, which in this case is Ethereum Mainnet. The proposal will contain instructions to mint 10 W tokens to the Optimism treasury and 15 ETH to the Arbitrum treasury.

In the following code snippet, we initialize the proposal with two transactions, each targeting the Hub's Message Dispatcher contract. These transactions will relay the governance actions to the respective spoke chains via Wormhole.

Key actions:

- Define the proposal targets (two transactions to the Message Dispatcher)
- Set values for each transaction (in this case, both are 0 as we're not transferring any native ETH)
- Encode the calldata for minting 10 W tokens on Optimism and sending 15 ETH to Arbitrum
- Finally, we submit the proposal to the `HubGovernor` contract

```solidity
HubGovernor governor = HubGovernor(GOVERNOR_ADDRESS);
// Prepare proposal details
address[] memory targets = new address[](2);
targets[0] = HUB_MESSAGE_DISPATCHER_ADDRESS;
targets[1] = HUB_MESSAGE_DISPATCHER_ADDRESS;
uint256[] memory values = new uint256[](2);
values[0] = 0;
values[1] = 0;
bytes[] memory calldatas = new bytes[](2);
// Prepare message for Optimism to mint 10 W tokens
// bytes created using abi.encodeWithSignature("mint(address,uint256)", 0xB0fFa8000886e57F86dd5264b9582b2Ad87b2b91, 10e18)
calldatas[0] = abi.encodeWithSignature(
    "dispatch(bytes)", 
    abi.encode(
        OPTIMISM_WORMHOLE_CHAIN_ID,
        [OPTIMISM_WORMHOLE_TREASURY_ADDRESS],
        [uint256(10 ether)],
        [hex"0x40c10f19000000000000000000000000b0ffa8000886e57f86dd5264b9582b2ad87b2b910000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008ac7230489e8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"] 
    )
);
// Prepare message for Arbitrum to receive 15 ETH
calldatas[1] = abi.encodeWithSignature(
    "dispatch(bytes)", 
    abi.encode(
        ARBITRUM_WORMHOLE_CHAIN_ID,
        [ARBITRUM_WORMHOLE_TREASURY_ADDRESS],
        [uint256(15 ether)],
        [hex"0x40c10f19000000000000000000000000b0ffa8000886e57f86dd5264b9582b2ad87b2b910000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008ac7230489e8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"] 
    )
);
string memory description = "Mint 10 W to Optimism treasury and 10 W to Arbitrum treasury via Wormhole";
// Create the proposal
uint256 proposalId = governor.propose(
    targets, values, calldatas, description
)
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `GOVERNOR_ADDRESS` ++"address"++

    The address of the `HubGovernor` contract on Ethereum Mainnet.

    ---

    `targets` ++"address[]"++

    An array that specifies the addresses that will receive the proposal's actions. Here, both are set to the `HUB_MESSAGE_DISPATCHER_ADDRESS`.

    ---

    `values` ++"uint256[]"++

    An array containing the value of each transaction (in Wei). In this case, both are set to zero because no ETH is being transferred.

    ---

    `calldatas` ++"bytes[]"++

    The calldata for the proposal. These are encoded contract calls containing cross-chain dispatch instructions for minting tokens and sending ETH. The calldata specifies minting 10 W tokens to the Optimism treasury and sending 15 ETH to the Arbitrum treasury.

    ---

    `description` ++"string"++

    A description of the proposal, outlining the intent to mint tokens to Optimism and send ETH to Arbitrum.

??? interface "Returns"

    `proposalId` ++"uint256"++

    The ID of the newly created proposal on the hub chain. 

## Vote on the Proposal via Spoke

Once the proposal is created on the hub chain, stakeholders can cast their votes on the spoke chains. This snippet demonstrates how to connect to a spoke chain and cast a vote for the proposal. The voting power (weight) is calculated based on each stakeholder's token holdings on the spoke chain.

Key actions:

- Connect to the `SpokeVoteAggregator` contract on the spoke chain. This contract aggregates votes from the spoke chains and relays them to the hub chain
- Cast a vote in support of the proposal

```solidity
// Connect to the SpokeVoteAggregator contract of the desired chain
SpokeVoteAggregator voteAggregator = SpokeVoteAggregator(VOTE_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS);
// Cast a vote
uint8 support = 1; // 1 for supporting, 0 for opposing
uint256 weight = voteAggregator.castVote(proposalId, support);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `VOTE_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS` ++"address"++

    The address of the `SpokeVoteAggregator` contract on the spoke chain (Optimism or Arbitrum).

    ---

    `proposalId` ++"uint256"++

    The ID of the proposal created on the hub chain, which is being voted on.

    ---

    `support` ++"uint8"++

    The vote being cast (`1` for supporting the proposal, `0` for opposing).

??? interface "Returns"

    `weight` ++"uint256"++

    The weight of the vote, determined by the voter’s token holdings on the spoke chain.

## Vote Aggregation

In the background process, votes cast on the spoke chains are aggregated and sent back to the hub chain for final tallying. This is typically handled off-chain by a "crank turner" service, which periodically queries the vote status and updates the hub chain.

Key actions:

- Aggregate votes from different chains and submit them to the hub chain for tallying

```solidity
// Aggregate votes sent to Hub (this would typically be done by a "crank turner" off-chain)
hubVotePool.crossChainVote(queryResponseRaw, signatures);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `queryResponseRaw` ++"bytes"++

    The raw vote data from the spoke chains.

    ---

    `signatures` ++"bytes"++

    Cryptographic signatures that verify the validity of the votes from the spoke chains.

## Execute Proposal and Dispatch Cross-Chain Messages

After the proposal passes and the votes are tallied, the next step is to execute the proposal. The `HubGovernor` contract will dispatch the cross-chain messages to the spoke chains, where the respective treasuries will receive the tokens.

Key actions:

- Execute the proposal after the voting period ends and the proposal passes
- The `execute` function finalizes the proposal execution by dispatching the cross-chain governance actions. The `descriptionHash` ensures that the executed proposal matches the one that was voted on.

```solidity
HubGovernor governor = HubGovernor(GOVERNOR_ADDRESS);
// Standard timelock execution
governor.execute(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `governor` ++"HubGovernor"++

    The `HubGovernor` contract instance.

    ---

    `targets` ++"address[]"++

    An array containing the target addresses for the proposal’s transactions (in this case, the `HUB_MESSAGE_DISPATCHER_ADDRESS` for both).

    ---

    `values` ++"uint256[]"++

    An array of values (in Wei) associated with each transaction (both are zero in this case).

    ---

    `calldatas` ++"bytes[]"++

    The encoded transaction data to dispatch the governance actions (e.g., minting tokens and transferring ETH).

    ---

    `descriptionHash` ++"bytes32"++

    A hash of the proposal’s description, used to verify the proposal before execution.

??? interface "Returns"

    No direct return, but executing this function finalizes the cross-chain governance actions by dispatching the encoded messages via Wormhole to the spoke chains.

Once the proposal is executed, the encoded messages will be dispatched via Wormhole to the spoke chains, where the Optimism and Arbitrum treasuries will receive their respective funds.

# Integrate Wormhole Settlement Routes Using the SDK

## Introduction

This guide explains integrating Wormhole Settlement Routes from the Wormhole SDK into your application. These Routes abstract the complexity of cross-chain token swaps by handling route discovery, fee estimation, and transaction construction, all useful for dApps seeking to embed cross-chain swaps. By following this tutorial you will install the Wormhole SDK Route package, configure and execute a swap, and explore error handling and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this project, make sure you have the following:

- **Wormhole SDK Route package** - installed using your preferred package manager

    To install the package with npm, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh
    npm install @mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route
    ```

    Alternatively, clone the repository and install dependencies:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route.git
    cd wormhole-sdk-route
    npm install
    ```

- **Data for parameters** - you will need: 
    
    - [Chain IDs](/docs/build/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} for the source and destination chains
    - An contract address for the token you want to swap and the token you want to receive on the destination chain

## Configure and Setup

To initiate a swap, you must create a configuration object that specifies all required parameters. These typically include:

- `sourceChain` - identifier for the chain where the swap begins
- `destinationChain` - identifier for the target chain
- `inputTokenAddress` - address of the token you want to swap
- `outputTokenAddress` - identifier/address of the desired token on the destination chain
- `amount` - the amount to swap (expressed in the smallest unit, e.g., wei for Ethereum)
- `slippageTolerance` - acceptable percentage of slippage (e.g., 0.005 for 0.5%)

```ts
import { SwapRoute, SwapRouteConfig } from '@mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route';

const config: SwapRouteConfig = {
  sourceChain: 'ethereum',
  destinationChain: 'solana',
  inputTokenAddress: '0xYourInputTokenAddress',
  outputTokenAddress: 'So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112', // Example token on Solana
  amount: '1000000000000000000', // For instance, 1 token in wei
  slippageTolerance: 0.005, // 0.5% slippage tolerance
  // Additional parameters may be included as needed
};

const swapRoute = new SwapRoute(config);
```

## Execute a Swap

Once the configuration is complete, the next steps are to retrieve the optimal swap route and execute the transaction.

### Fetch the Swap Route

Before sending a transaction, fetch the optimal swap route to review details such as fees and expected outputs:

```ts
async function getSwapDetails() {
  try {
    const routeDetails = await swapRoute.getRoute();
    console.log('Optimal Swap Route:', routeDetails);
    return routeDetails;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching swap route:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

getSwapDetails();
```

### Execute the Swap Transaction

Once the route is confirmed, execute the swap:

```ts
async function executeSwap() {
  try {
    const txResponse = await swapRoute.executeSwap();
    console.log('Swap executed successfully:', txResponse);
    // Further transaction handling (e.g., waiting for confirmation) can be added here.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Swap execution failed:', error);
  }
}

executeSwap();
```

## Complete Example Integration

Below is a complete example that puts together configuration, route fetching, and swap execution:

```ts
import { SwapRoute, SwapRouteConfig } from '@mayan-finance/wormhole-sdk-route';

async function performSwap() {
  // Configure the swap parameters
  const config: SwapRouteConfig = {
    sourceChain: 'ethereum',
    destinationChain: 'solana',
    inputTokenAddress: '0xYourInputTokenAddress',
    outputTokenAddress: 'So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112',
    amount: '1000000000000000000',
    slippageTolerance: 0.005,
    // Include additional settings as needed
  };

  // Initialize the swap route
  const swapRoute = new SwapRoute(config);

  try {
    // Retrieve the optimal swap route details
    const routeDetails = await swapRoute.getRoute();
    console.log('Optimal Swap Route:', routeDetails);

    // Execute the swap transaction
    const txResponse = await swapRoute.executeSwap();
    console.log('Swap Transaction Response:', txResponse);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred during the swap process:', error);
  }
}

performSwap();
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- **Route fetching errors** - ensure all configuration parameters (chain IDs, token addresses, amounts) are correct and that network endpoints are reachable
- **Transaction execution errors** - verify that the connected wallet has sufficient funds and that transaction parameters meet the network’s requirements. Detailed logging can assist with troubleshooting
- **Miscellaneous** - to pass a `ReferrerAddress` to the initiation functions, you can create a class that extends the `MayanRoute` class. Override the `referrerAddress` method to return addresses by platform, as shown in this example:

    ```ts
    class MayanRefRoute<N extends Network> extends MayanRoute<N> {
        override referrerAddress(): ReferrerAddresses | undefined {
            return { evm: "0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbe" };
        }
    }
    ```

---

# Transfer Tokens via the Token Bridge

:simple-github: [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-basic-ts-sdk/){target=\_blank}

## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through building a cross-chain token transfer application using the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank} and its [Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/){target=\_blank} method. The Token Bridge method enables secure and efficient cross-chain asset transfers across different blockchain networks, allowing users to move tokens seamlessly.

By leveraging Wormhole’s Token Bridge, this guide shows you how to build an application that supports multiple transfer types:

 - EVM to EVM (e.g., Ethereum to Avalanche)
 - EVM to non-EVM chains (e.g., Ethereum to Solana)
 - Non-EVM to EVM chains (e.g., Sui to Avalanche)
 - Non-EVM to non-EVM chains (e.g., Solana to Sui)

Existing solutions for cross-chain transfers can be complex and inefficient, requiring multiple steps and transaction fees. However, the Token Bridge method from Wormhole simplifies the process by handling the underlying attestation, transaction validation, and message passing across blockchains.

At the end of this guide, you’ll have a fully functional setup for transferring assets across chains using Wormhole’s Token Bridge method.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

 - [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank} installed on your machine
 - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/){target=\_blank} installed globally
 - Native tokens (testnet or mainnet) in Solana and Sui wallets
 - A wallet with a private key, funded with native tokens (testnet or mainnet) for gas fees

## Supported Chains

The Wormhole SDK supports a wide range of EVM and non-EVM chains, allowing you to facilitate cross-chain transfers efficiently. You can find a complete list of supported chains in the Wormhole SDK [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/5810ebbd3635aaf1b5ab675da3f99f62aec2210f/core/base/src/constants/circle.ts#L14-L30){target=\_blank}, which covers both testnet and mainnet environments.

## Project Setup

In this section, we’ll guide you through initializing the project, installing dependencies, and preparing your environment for cross-chain transfers.

1. **Initialize the project** - start by creating a new directory for your project and initializing it with `npm`, which will create the `package.json` file for your project

    ```bash
    mkdir native-transfers
    cd native-transfers
    npm init -y
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** - install the required dependencies, including the Wormhole SDK and helper libraries

    ```bash
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk dotenv tsx
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables** - to securely store your private key, create a `.env` file in the root of your project

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    Inside the `.env` file, add your private keys.

    ```env
    ETH_PRIVATE_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
    SOL_PRIVATE_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
    SUI_PRIVATE_KEY="INSERT_SUI_MNEMONIC"
    ```

    !!! note
        Ensure your private key contains native tokens for gas on both the source and destination chains. For Sui, you must provide a mnemonic instead of a private key.

4. **Create a `helpers.ts` file** - to simplify the interaction between chains, create a file to store utility functions for fetching your private key, set up signers for different chains, and manage transaction relays

    1. Create the helpers file

        ```bash
        mkdir -p src/helpers
        touch src/helpers/helpers.ts
        ```

    2. Open the `helpers.ts` file and add the following code

        ```typescript
        import {
  ChainAddress,
  ChainContext,
  Network,
  Signer,
  Wormhole,
  Chain,
  TokenId,
  isTokenId,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import aptos from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/aptos';
import { config } from 'dotenv';
config();

        - **`getEnv`** - this function fetches environment variables like your private key from the `.env` file
        - **`getSigner`** - based on the chain you're working with (EVM, Solana, Sui, etc.), this function retrieves a signer for that specific platform. The signer is responsible for signing transactions and interacting with the blockchain. It securely uses the private key stored in your `.env` file
        - **`getTokenDecimals`** - this function fetches the number of decimals for a token on a specific chain. It helps handle token amounts accurately during transfers

## Check and Create Wrapped Tokens

Before tokens are transferred across chains, it should be checked whether a wrapped version exists on the destination chain. If not, an attestation must be generated to wrap it so it can be sent and received on that chain.

In this section, you'll create a script that automates this process by checking whether Arbitrum Sepolia has a wrapped version on Base Sepolia and registering it if needed.

### Configure the Wrapped Token Script

1. **Create the `create-wrapped.ts` file** - set up the script file that will handle checking and wrapping tokens in the `src` directory

    ```bash
    mkdir -p src/scripts
    touch src/scripts/create-wrapped.ts
    ```

2. **Open `create-wrapped.ts` and import the required modules** - import the necessary SDK modules to interact with Wormhole, EVM, Solana, and Sui chains, as well as helper functions for signing and sending transactions

    ```typescript
    import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import { inspect } from 'util';
import { getSigner } from '../helpers/helpers';
    ```

3. **Initialize the Wormhole SDK** - initialize the `wormhole` function for the `Testnet` environment and specify the platforms (EVM, Solana, and Sui) to support

    ```typescript
    const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm, solana, sui]);
    ```

    !!! note
        You can replace `'Testnet'` with `'Mainnet'` if you want to perform transfers on Mainnet.

4. **Configure transfer parameters** - specify Arbitrum Sepolia as the source chain and Base Sepolia as the destination, retrieve the token ID from the source chain for transfer, and set the gas limit (optional)

    ```typescript
    const destChain = wh.getChain('BaseSepolia');
  const token = await srcChain.getNativeWrappedTokenId();
  const gasLimit = BigInt(2_500_000);
    ```

5. **Set up the destination chain signer** -  the signer authorizes transactions, such as submitting the attestation

    ```typescript
    
    ```

6. **Check if the token is wrapped on the destination chain** - verify if the token already exists as a wrapped asset before creating an attestation

    ```typescript
    try {
    const wrapped = await tbDest.getWrappedAsset(token);
    console.log(
      `Token already wrapped on ${destChain.chain}. Skipping attestation.`
    );
    return { chain: destChain.chain, address: wrapped };
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(
      `No wrapped token found on ${destChain.chain}. Proceeding with attestation.`
    );
  }
    ```

    If the token is already wrapped, the script exits, and you may proceed to the [next section](/docs/tutorials/by-product/wormhole-sdk/tokens-via-token-bridge/#token-transfers). Otherwise, an attestation must be generated.

7. **Set up the source chain signer** -  the signer creates and submits the attestation transaction

    ```typescript
    
    ```

8. **Create an attestation transaction** - generate and send an attestation for the token on the source chain to register it on the destination chain, then save the transaction ID to verify the attestation in the next step

    ```typescript
    const attestTxns = tbOrig.createAttestation(
    token.address,
    Wormhole.parseAddress(origSigner.chain(), origSigner.address())
  );

  const txids = await signSendWait(srcChain, attestTxns, origSigner);
  console.log('txids: ', inspect(txids, { depth: null }));
  const txid = txids[0]!.txid;
  console.log('Created attestation (save this): ', txid);
    ```

9. **Retrieve the signed VAA** - once the attestation transaction is confirmed, use `parseTransaction(txid)` to extract Wormhole messages, then retrieve the signed VAA from the messages. The timeout defines how long to wait for the VAA before failure

    ```typescript
    console.log('Parsed Messages:', msgs);

  const timeout = 25 * 60 * 1000;
  const vaa = await wh.getVaa(msgs[0]!, 'TokenBridge:AttestMeta', timeout);
  if (!vaa) {
    throw new Error(
      'VAA not found after retries exhausted. Try extending the timeout.'
    );
  }
    ```

10. **Submit the attestation on the destination chain** - submit the signed VAA using `submitAttestation(vaa, recipient)` to create the wrapped token on the destination chain, then send the transaction and await confirmation

    ```typescript
    vaa,
    Wormhole.parseAddress(destSigner.chain(), destSigner.address())
  );

  const tsx = await signSendWait(destChain, subAttestation, destSigner);
    ```

11. **Wait for the wrapped asset to be available** - poll until the wrapped token is available on the destination chain

    ```typescript
    do {
      try {
        const wrapped = await tbDest.getWrappedAsset(token);
        return { chain: destChain.chain, address: wrapped };
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Wrapped asset not found yet. Retrying...');
      }
      console.log('Waiting before checking again...');
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 2000));
    } while (true);
  }

  console.log('Wrapped Asset: ', await waitForIt());
})().catch((e) => console.error(e));
    ```

    If the token is not found, it logs a message and retries after a short delay. Once the wrapped asset is detected, its address is returned.

    } while (true);
  }

  console.log('Wrapped Asset: ', await waitForIt());
})().catch((e) => console.error(e));
    ```

### Run the Wrapped Token Creation

Once the script is ready, execute it with:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/create-wrapped.ts
```

If the token is already wrapped, the script exits. Otherwise, it generates an attestation and submits it. Once complete, you’re ready to transfer tokens across chains.

## Token Transfers

In this section, you'll create a script to transfer native tokens across chains using Wormhole's Token Bridge method. The script will handle the transfer of Sui native tokens to Solana, demonstrating the seamless cross-chain transfer capabilities of the Wormhole SDK. Since both chains are non-EVM compatible, you'll need to manually handle the attestation and finalization steps.

### Configure Transfer Details

Before initiating a cross-chain transfer, you must set up the chain context and signers for both the source and destination chains.

1. Create the `native-transfer.ts` file in the `src` directory to hold your script for transferring native tokens across chains

    ```bash
    touch src/scripts/native-transfer.ts
    ```

2. Open the `native-transfer.ts` file and begin by importing the necessary modules from the SDK and helper files

    ```typescript
    Chain,
  Network,
  Wormhole,
  amount,
  wormhole,
  TokenId,
  TokenTransfer,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import { SignerStuff, getSigner, getTokenDecimals } from '../helpers/helpers';
    ```

3. **Initialize the Wormhole SDK** - initialize the `wormhole` function for the `Testnet` environment and specify the platforms (EVM, Solana, and Sui) to support

    ```typescript
    const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm, solana, sui]);
    ```

4. **Set up source and destination chains** - specify the source chain (Sui) and the destination chain (Solana) using the `getChain` method. This allows us to define where to send the native tokens and where to receive them

    ```typescript
    const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Solana');
    ```

5. **Configure the signers** - use the `getSigner` function to retrieve the signers responsible for signing transactions on the respective chains. This ensures that transactions are correctly authorized on both the source and destination chains

    ```typescript
    const destination = await getSigner(rcvChain);
    ```

6. **Define the token to transfer** - specify the native token on the source chain (Sui in this example) by creating a `TokenId` object

    ```typescript
    
    ```

7. **Define the transfer amount** - the amount of native tokens to transfer is specified. In this case, we're transferring 1 unit

    ```typescript
    
    ```

8. **Set transfer mode** - specify that the transfer should be manual by setting `automatic = false`. This means you will need to handle the attestation and finalization steps yourself

    ```typescript
    
    ```

    !!! note
        Automatic transfers are only supported for EVM chains. For non-EVM chains like Solana and Sui, you must manually handle the attestation and finalization steps.
    
9. **Define decimals** - fetch the number of decimals for the token on the source chain (Sui) using the `getTokenDecimals` function

    ```typescript
    
    ```

10. **Perform the token transfer and exit the process** - initiate the transfer by calling the `tokenTransfer` function, which we’ll define in the next step. This function takes an object containing all required details for executing the transfer, including the `source` and `destination` chains, `token`, `mode`, and transfer `amount`

    ```typescript
    token,
    amount: amount.units(amount.parse(amt, decimals)),
    source,
    destination,
    automatic,
  });
    ```

    Finally, we use `process.exit(0);` to close the script once the transfer completes

    ```typescript
    })();
    ```

### Token Transfer Logic

This section defines the `tokenTransfer` function, which manages the core steps for cross-chain transfer execution. This function will handle initiating the transfer on the source chain, retrieving the attestation, and completing the transfer on the destination chain.

#### Defining the Token Transfer Function

The `tokenTransfer` function initiates and manages the transfer process, handling all necessary steps to move tokens across chains with the Wormhole SDK. This function uses types from the SDK and our `helpers.ts` file to ensure chain compatibility.

```typescript
wh: Wormhole<N>,
  route: {
    token: TokenId;
    amount: bigint;
    source: SignerStuff<N, Chain>;
    destination: SignerStuff<N, Chain>;
    automatic: boolean;
    payload?: Uint8Array;
  }
) {
  // Token Transfer Logic
import {
  Chain,
  Network,
  Wormhole,
  amount,
  wormhole,
  TokenId,
  TokenTransfer,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import { SignerStuff, getSigner, getTokenDecimals } from '../helpers/helpers';

(async function () {
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm, solana, sui]);

  // Set up source and destination chains
  const sendChain = wh.getChain('Sui');
  const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Solana');

  // Get signer from local key but anything that implements
  const source = await getSigner(sendChain);
  const destination = await getSigner(rcvChain);

  // Shortcut to allow transferring native gas token
  const token = Wormhole.tokenId(sendChain.chain, 'native');

  // Define the amount of tokens to transfer
  const amt = '1';

  // Set automatic transfer to false for manual transfer
  const automatic = false;

  // Used to normalize the amount to account for the tokens decimals
  const decimals = await getTokenDecimals(wh, token, sendChain);

  // Perform the token transfer if no recovery transaction ID is provided
  const xfer = await tokenTransfer(wh, {
    token,
    amount: amount.units(amount.parse(amt, decimals)),
    source,
    destination,
    automatic,
  });

  process.exit(0);
})();

async function tokenTransfer<N extends Network>(
  wh: Wormhole<N>,
  route: {
    token: TokenId;
    amount: bigint;
    source: SignerStuff<N, Chain>;
    destination: SignerStuff<N, Chain>;
    automatic: boolean;
    payload?: Uint8Array;
  }
) {
  // Token Transfer Logic
  // Create a TokenTransfer object to track the state of the transfer over time
  const xfer = await wh.tokenTransfer(
    route.token,
    route.amount,
    route.source.address,
    route.destination.address,
    route.automatic ?? false,
    route.payload
  );

  const quote = await TokenTransfer.quoteTransfer(
    wh,
    route.source.chain,
    route.destination.chain,
    xfer.transfer
  );

  if (xfer.transfer.automatic && quote.destinationToken.amount < 0)
    throw 'The amount requested is too low to cover the fee and any native gas requested.';

  // Submit the transactions to the source chain, passing a signer to sign any txns
  console.log('Starting transfer');
  const srcTxids = await xfer.initiateTransfer(route.source.signer);
  console.log(`Source Trasaction ID: ${srcTxids[0]}`);
  console.log(`Wormhole Trasaction ID: ${srcTxids[1] ?? srcTxids[0]}`);

  // Wait for the VAA to be signed and ready (not required for auto transfer)
  console.log('Getting Attestation');
  await xfer.fetchAttestation(60_000);

  // Redeem the VAA on the dest chain
  console.log('Completing Transfer');
  const destTxids = await xfer.completeTransfer(route.destination.signer);
  console.log(`Completed Transfer: `, destTxids);
}
```

#### Steps to Transfer Tokens

The `tokenTransfer` function consists of several key steps to facilitate the cross-chain transfer. Let’s break down each step:

1. **Initialize the transfer object** - the `tokenTransfer` function begins by creating a `TokenTransfer` object, `xfer`, which tracks the state of the transfer process and provides access to relevant methods for each transfer step

    ```typescript
    route.token,
    route.amount,
    route.source.address,
    route.destination.address,
    route.automatic ?? false,
    route.payload
  );
    ```

2. **Estimate transfer fees and validate amount** - we obtain a fee quote for the transfer before proceeding. This step is significant in automatic mode (`automatic = true`), where the quote will include additional fees for relaying

    ```typescript
    wh,
    route.source.chain,
    route.destination.chain,
    xfer.transfer
  );

  if (xfer.transfer.automatic && quote.destinationToken.amount < 0)
    throw 'The amount requested is too low to cover the fee and any native gas requested.';
    ```

3. **Submit the transaction to the source chain** - initiate the transfer on the source chain by submitting the transaction using `route.source.signer`, starting the token transfer process

    ```typescript
    console.log(`Source Trasaction ID: ${srcTxids[0]}`);
    ```

     - **`srcTxids`** - the resulting transaction IDs are printed to the console. These IDs can be used to track the transfer’s progress on the source chain and [Wormhole network](https://wormholescan.io/#/?network=Testnet){target=\_blank}

    ???- note "How Cross-Chain Transfers Work in the Background"
        When `xfer.initiateTransfer(route.source.signer)` is called, it initiates the transfer on the source chain. Here’s what happens in the background:

         - **Token lock or burn** - tokens are either locked in a smart contract or burned on the source chain, representing the transfer amount
         - **VAA creation** - Wormhole’s network of Guardians generates a Verifiable Action Approval (VAA)—a signed proof of the transaction, which ensures it’s recognized across chains
         - **Tracking the transfer** - the returned transaction IDs allow you to track the transfer's progress both on the source chain and within Wormhole’s network
         - **Redemption on destination** - once detected, the VAA is used to release or mint the corresponding token amount on the destination chain, completing the transfer

        This process ensures a secure and verifiable transfer across chains, from locking tokens on the source chain to redeeming them on the destination chain.

4. **Wait for the attestation** - retrieve the Wormhole attestation (VAA), which serves as cryptographic proof of the transfer. In manual mode, you must wait for the VAA before redeeming the transfer on the destination chain

    ```typescript
    
    ```

5. **Complete the transfer on the destination chain** - redeem the VAA on the destination chain to finalize the transfer

    ```typescript
    console.log(`Completed Transfer: `, destTxids);
    ```

??? code "Complete script"
    ```typescript
    import {
  Chain,
  Network,
  Wormhole,

  TokenTransfer,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';

import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import { SignerStuff, getSigner, getTokenDecimals } from '../helpers/helpers';

(async function () {
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm, solana, sui]);

  // Set up source and destination chains
  const sendChain = wh.getChain('Sui');
  const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Solana');

  });

  process.exit(0);
})();

  wh: Wormhole<N>,
  route: {
    token: TokenId;

    source: SignerStuff<N, Chain>;
    destination: SignerStuff<N, Chain>;
    automatic: boolean;
    payload?: Uint8Array;
  }
) {
  // Token Transfer Logic
  // Create a TokenTransfer object to track the state of the transfer over time
  const xfer = await wh.tokenTransfer(
    route.token,
    route.amount,
    route.source.address,
    route.destination.address,
    route.automatic ?? false,
    route.payload
  );

  const quote = await TokenTransfer.quoteTransfer(
    wh,
    route.source.chain,
    route.destination.chain,
    xfer.transfer
  );

  if (xfer.transfer.automatic && quote.destinationToken.amount < 0)
    throw 'The amount requested is too low to cover the fee and any native gas requested.';

  // Submit the transactions to the source chain, passing a signer to sign any txns
  console.log('Starting transfer');
  const srcTxids = await xfer.initiateTransfer(route.source.signer);
  console.log(`Source Trasaction ID: ${srcTxids[0]}`);
  console.log(`Wormhole Trasaction ID: ${srcTxids[1] ?? srcTxids[0]}`);

  // Wait for the VAA to be signed and ready (not required for auto transfer)

  console.log('Completing Transfer');
  const destTxids = await xfer.completeTransfer(route.destination.signer);
  console.log(`Completed Transfer: `, destTxids);
}
    ```

### Run the Native Token Transfer

Now that you’ve set up the project and defined the transfer logic, you can execute the script to transfer native tokens from the Sui chain to Solana. You can use `tsx` to run the TypeScript file directly:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/native-transfer.ts
```

This initiates the native token transfer from the source chain (Sui) and completes it on the destination chain (Solana).

You can monitor the status of the transaction on the [Wormhole explorer](https://wormholescan.io/#/?network=Testnet){target=\_blank}.

## Resources

If you'd like to explore the complete project or need a reference while following this tutorial, you can find the complete codebase in [Wormhole's demo GitHub repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-basic-ts-sdk/){target=\_blank}. The repository includes all the example scripts and configurations needed to perform native token cross-chain transfers, including manual, automatic, and partial transfers using the Wormhole SDK.

## Conclusion

You've successfully built a cross-chain token transfer application using Wormhole's TypeScript SDK and the Token Bridge method. This guide took you through the setup, configuration, and transfer logic required to move native tokens across non-EVM chains like Sui and Solana.

The same transfer logic will apply if you’d like to extend this application to different chain combinations, including EVM-compatible chains.

## Introduction

In this guide, we will show you how to bridge native USDC across different blockchain networks using [Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol](/docs/learn/transfers/cctp/){target=\_blank} (CCTP) and [Wormhole’s TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/tree/main){target=\_blank}.

Traditionally, cross-chain transfers using CCTP involve multiple manual steps, such as initiating the transfer on the source chain, relaying messages between chains, and covering gas fees on both the source and destination chains. Without the TypeScript SDK, developers must handle these operations independently, adding complexity and increasing the chance for errors, mainly when dealing with gas payments on the destination chain and native gas token management.

Wormhole’s TypeScript SDK simplifies this process by offering automated transfer relaying and handling gas payments on the destination chain. It also offers an option to include native gas tokens for seamless execution. This reduces developer overhead, makes transfers faster and more reliable, and enhances the user experience.

In this guide, we’ll first explore the theory behind CCTP and then provide a step-by-step tutorial for integrating Wormhole’s TypeScript SDK into your application to streamline USDC transfers across multiple chains.

## Core Concepts

When bridging assets across chains, there are two primary approaches to handling the transfer process: manual and automated. Below, you may find the differences between these approaches and how they impact the user experience:

 - **Manual transfers** - manual transfers involve three key steps: initiating the transfer on the source chain, fetching the Circle attestation to verify the transfer, and completing the transfer on the destination chain

 - **Automated transfers** - automatic transfers simplify the process by handling Circle attestations and finalization for you. With Wormhole's automated relaying, you only need to initiate the transfer, and the rest is managed for you

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

 - [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank} installed on your machine
 - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/){target=\_blank} installed globally
 - [USDC tokens](https://faucet.circle.com/){target=\_blank} on supported chains. This tutorial uses Avalanche and Sepolia as examples
 - A wallet with a private key, funded with native tokens (Testnet or Mainnet) for gas fees

## Supported Chains

The Wormhole SDK supports a wide range of EVM and non-EVM chains, allowing you to facilitate cross-chain transfers efficiently. You can find a complete list of supported chains in the Wormhole SDK [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/5810ebbd3635aaf1b5ab675da3f99f62aec2210f/core/base/src/constants/circle.ts#L14-L30){target=_blank}, which covers both Testnet and Mainnet environments.

## Project Setup

In this section, you'll set up your project for transferring USDC across chains using Wormhole's SDK and Circle's CCTP. We’ll guide you through initializing the project, installing dependencies, and preparing your environment for cross-chain transfers.

1. **Initialize the project** - start by creating a new directory for your project and initializing it with `npm`, which will create the `package.json` file for your project

    ```bash
    mkdir cctp-circle
    cd cctp-circle
    npm init -y
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** - install the required dependencies, including the Wormhole SDK and helper libraries

    ```bash
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk dotenv
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables** - to securely store your private key, create a `.env` file in the root of your project

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    Inside the `.env` file, add your private key

    ```env
    ETH_PRIVATE_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
    SOL_PRIVATE_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
    ```

    !!! note
        Ensure your private key contains USDC funds and native tokens for gas on both the source and destination chains.

4. **Create a `helpers.ts` file** - to simplify the interaction between chains, create a file to store utility functions for fetching your private key, setting up signers for different chains, and managing transaction relays

    1. Create the helpers file

        ```bash
        mkdir helpers
        touch helpers/helpers.ts
        ```

    2. Open the `helpers.ts` file and add the following code

        ```typescript
        import {
  ChainAddress,
  ChainContext,
  Network,
  Signer,
  Wormhole,
  Chain,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import { config } from 'dotenv';
config();

export interface SignerStuff<N extends Network, C extends Chain> {
  chain: ChainContext<N, C>;
  signer: Signer<N, C>;
  address: ChainAddress<C>;
}

// Function to fetch environment variables (like your private key)
function getEnv(key: string): string {
  const val = process.env[key];
  if (!val) throw new Error(`Missing environment variable: ${key}`);
  return val;
}

// Signer setup function for different blockchain platforms
export async function getSigner<N extends Network, C extends Chain>(
  chain: ChainContext<N, C>
): Promise<{
  chain: ChainContext<N, C>;
  signer: Signer<N, C>;
  address: ChainAddress<C>;
}> {
  let signer: Signer;
  const platform = chain.platform.utils()._platform;

  switch (platform) {
    case 'Solana':
      signer = await (
        await solana()
      ).getSigner(await chain.getRpc(), getEnv('SOL_PRIVATE_KEY'));
      break;
    case 'Evm':
      signer = await (
        await evm()
      ).getSigner(await chain.getRpc(), getEnv('ETH_PRIVATE_KEY'));
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error('Unsupported platform: ' + platform);
  }

  return {
    chain,
    signer: signer as Signer<N, C>,
    address: Wormhole.chainAddress(chain.chain, signer.address()),
  };
}
        ```

        - **`getEnv`** - this function fetches environment variables like your private key from the `.env` file
        - **`getSigner`** - based on the chain you're working with (EVM, Solana, etc.), this function retrieves a signer for that specific platform. The signer is responsible for signing transactions and interacting with the blockchain. It securely uses the private key stored in your `.env` file

5. **Create the main script** - create a new file named `manual-transfer.ts` to hold your script for transferring USDC across chains

    1. Create the `manual-transfer.ts` file in the `src` directory

        ```bash
        touch src/manual-transfer.ts
        ```

    2. Open the `manual-transfer.ts` file and begin by importing the necessary modules from the SDK and helper files

        ```typescript
        import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import { getSigner } from './helpers/helpers';
        ```

        - **`evm`** - this import is for working with EVM-compatible chains, like Avalanche, Ethereum, Base Sepolia, and more
        - **`solana`** - this adds support for Solana, a non-EVM chain
        - **`getSigner`** - utility function from the helper file that retrieves the signer to sign transactions

## Manual Transfers

In a manual USDC transfer, you perform each step of the cross-chain transfer process individually. This approach allows for greater control and flexibility over how the transfer is executed, which can be helpful in scenarios where you need to customize certain aspects of the transfer, such as gas management, specific chain selection, or signing transactions manually.

This section will guide you through performing a manual USDC transfer across chains using the Wormhole SDK and Circle’s CCTP.

### Set Up the Transfer Environment

#### Configure Transfer Details

Before initiating a cross-chain transfer, you must set up the chain context and signers for both the source and destination chains.

1. **Initialize the Wormhole SDK** - initialize the `wormhole` function for the `Testnet` environment and specify the platforms (EVM and Solana) to support. This allows us to interact with both EVM-compatible chains like Avalanche and non-EVM chains like Solana if needed

    ```typescript
    const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm, solana]);
    ```
    
    !!! note
        You can replace `'Testnet'` with `'Mainnet'` if you want to perform transfers on Mainnet.

2. **Set up source and destination chains** - specify the source chain (Avalanche) and the destination chain (Sepolia) using the `getChain` method. This allows us to define where to send the USDC and where to receive them

    ```typescript
    const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Sepolia');
    ```

3. **Configure the signers** - use the `getSigner` function to retrieve the signers responsible for signing transactions on the respective chains. This ensures that transactions are correctly authorized on both the source and destination chains

    ```typescript
    const destination = await getSigner(rcvChain);
    ```

4. **Define the transfer amount** - the amount of USDC to transfer is specified. In this case, we're transferring 0.1 USDC, which is parsed and converted into the base units expected by the Wormhole SDK

    ```typescript
    
    ```

5. **Set transfer mode** - we specify that the transfer should be manual by setting `automatic = false`. This means you will need to handle the attestation and finalization steps yourself

    ```typescript
    
    ```

#### Initiate the Transfer

To begin the manual transfer process, you first need to create the transfer object and then manually initiate the transfer on the source chain.

1. **Create the Circle transfer object** - the `wh.circleTransfer()` function creates an object with the  transfer details, such as the amount of USDC, the source and destination addresses, and the mode. However, this does not initiate the transfer itself

    ```typescript
    amt,
    source.address,
    destination.address,
    automatic
  );
    ```

2. **Start the transfer** - the `initiateTransfer` function sends the transaction on the source chain. It involves signing and sending the transaction using the source signer. This will return a list of transaction IDs (`srcTxIds`) that you can use to track the transfer

    ```typescript
    console.log(`Started Transfer: `, srcTxids);
    ```

#### Fetch the Circle Attestation (VAA)

Once you initialize the transfer on the source chain, you must fetch the VAA from Circle. The VAA serves as cryptographic proof that CCTP has successfully recognized the transfer. The transfer cannot be completed on the destination chain until this attestation is fetched.


1. **Set a timeout** - fetching the attestation can take some time, so setting a timeout is common. In this example, we set the timeout to 60 seconds

    ```typescript
    
    ```

2. **Fetch the attestation** - after initiating the transfer, you can use the `fetchAttestation()` function to retrieve the VAA. This function will wait until the attestation is available or you reach the specified timeout

    ```typescript
    console.log(`Got Attestation: `, attestIds);
    ```

    The `attestIds` will contain the details of the fetched attestation, which Wormhole uses to complete the transfer on the destination chain

#### Complete the Transfer on the Destination Chain

Once you fetch the VAA correctly, the final step is to complete the transfer on the destination chain (Sepolia in this example). This involves redeeming the VAA, which moves the USDC from Circle's custody onto the destination chain.

Use the `completeTransfer()` function to finalize the transfer on the destination chain. This requires the destination signer to sign and submit the transaction to the destination chain

```typescript
console.log(`Completed Transfer: `, dstTxids);

  console.log('Circle Transfer status: ', xfer);

  process.exit(0);
```

The `dstTxIds` will hold the transaction IDs for the transfer on the destination chain, confirming that the transfer has been completed

You can find the full code for the manual USDC transfer script below:

???- code "`manual-transfer.ts`"
    ```typescript
    import { wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import { getSigner } from './helpers/helpers';

(async function () {
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm, solana]);

  // Set up source and destination chains
  const sendChain = wh.getChain('Avalanche');
  const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Sepolia');

  // Configure the signers
  const source = await getSigner(sendChain);
  const destination = await getSigner(rcvChain);

  // Define the transfer amount (in the smallest unit, so 0.1 USDC = 100,000 units assuming 6 decimals)
  const amt = 100_000n;

  const automatic = false;

  // Create the Circle transfer object 
  const xfer = await wh.circleTransfer(
    amt,
    source.address,
    destination.address,
    automatic
  );

  console.log('Circle Transfer object created:', xfer);

  // Initiate the transfer on the source chain (Avalanche)
  console.log('Starting Transfer');
  const srcTxids = await xfer.initiateTransfer(source.signer);
  console.log(`Started Transfer: `, srcTxids);

  // Wait for Circle Attestation (VAA)
  const timeout = 60 * 1000; // Timeout in milliseconds (60 seconds)
  console.log('Waiting for Attestation');
  const attestIds = await xfer.fetchAttestation(timeout);
  console.log(`Got Attestation: `, attestIds);

  // Complete the transfer on the destination chain (Sepolia)
  console.log('Completing Transfer');
  const dstTxids = await xfer.completeTransfer(destination.signer);
  console.log(`Completed Transfer: `, dstTxids);

  console.log('Circle Transfer status: ', xfer);

  process.exit(0);
})();
    ```

### Run Manual Transfer

To execute the manual transfer script, you can use `ts-node` to run the TypeScript file directly

```bash
npx ts-node src/manual-transfer.ts
```

This will initiate the USDC transfer from the source chain (Avalanche) and complete it on the destination chain (Sepolia).

You can monitor the status of the transaction on the [Wormhole explorer](https://wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}.

### Complete Partial Transfer

In some cases, a manual transfer might start but not finish—perhaps the user terminates their session, or there's an issue before the transfer can be completed. The Wormhole SDK allows you to reconstitute the transfer object from the transaction hash on the source chain.

This feature is handy for recovering an incomplete transfer or when debugging.

Here’s how you can complete a partial transfer using just the source chain and transaction hash:

```typescript
wh,
    {
      chain: 'Avalanche',
      txid: '0x6b6d5f101a32aa6d2f7bf0bf14d72bfbf76a640e1b2fdbbeeac5b82069cda4dd',
    },
    timeout
  );

  const dstTxIds = await xfer.completeTransfer(destination.signer);
  console.log('Completed transfer: ', dstTxIds);
```

You will need to provide the below requirements to complete the partial transfer:

- **Transaction ID (`txId`)** - the transaction hash from the source chain where the transfer was initiated
- **Signer for the destination chain (`destination.signer`)** - the wallet or private key that can authorize and complete the transfer on the destination chain. This signer is the same as the `destination.signer` defined in the manual transfer setup

This allows you to resume the transfer process by rebuilding the transfer object and completing it on the destination chain. It's especially convenient when debugging or handling interrupted transfers.

You can find the full code for the manual USDC transfer script below:

??? code "`partial-transfer.ts`"
    ```typescript
    import { CircleTransfer, wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import { getSigner } from '../helpers/helpers';

(async function () {
  // Initialize the Wormhole object for the Testnet environment and add supported chains (evm and solana)
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm, solana]);

  // Grab chain Contexts -- these hold a reference to a cached rpc client
  const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Sepolia');

  // Get signer from local key
  const destination = await getSigner(rcvChain);

  const timeout = 60 * 1000; // Timeout in milliseconds (60 seconds)

  // Rebuild the transfer from the source txid
  const xfer = await CircleTransfer.from(
    wh,
    {
      chain: 'Avalanche',
      txid: '0x6b6d5f101a32aa6d2f7bf0bf14d72bfbf76a640e1b2fdbbeeac5b82069cda4dd',
    },
    timeout
  );

  const dstTxIds = await xfer.completeTransfer(destination.signer);
  console.log('Completed transfer: ', dstTxIds);

  console.log('Circle Transfer status: ', xfer);

  process.exit(0);
})();
    ```

## Automatic Transfers

The automatic transfer process simplifies the steps by automating the attestation fetching and transfer completion. All you need to do is initiate the transfer.

### Set Up the Transfer Environment

#### Configure Transfer Details

The setup for automatic transfers is similar to manual transfers, with the key difference being that the `automatic` flag is `true`. This indicates that Wormhole will handle the attestation and finalization steps for you

```typescript

```

#### Initiate the Transfer

The transfer process is the same as that for manual transfers. You create the transfer object and then start the transfer on the source chain

```typescript
amt,
    source.address,
    destination.address,
    automatic
  );
```

#### Log Transfer Details

After initiating the transfer, you can log the transaction IDs for both the source and destination chains. This will help you track the progress of the transfer

```typescript
console.log(`Started Transfer: `, srcTxids);

  process.exit(0);
```

You can find the full code for the automatic USDC transfer script below:

??? code "`automatic-transfer.ts`"
    ```typescript
    import { wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import { getSigner } from '../helpers/helpers';

(async function () {
  // Initialize the Wormhole object for the Testnet environment and add supported chains (evm and solana)
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm, solana]);

  // Set up source and destination chains
  const sendChain = wh.getChain('Avalanche');
  const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Sepolia');

  // Configure the signers
  const source = await getSigner(sendChain);
  const destination = await getSigner(rcvChain);

  // Define the transfer amount (in the smallest unit, so 0.1 USDC = 100,000 units assuming 6 decimals)
  const amt = 100_000_001n;

  const automatic = true;

  // Create the Circle transfer object (USDC-only)
  const xfer = await wh.circleTransfer(
    amt,
    source.address,
    destination.address,
    automatic
  );

  console.log('Circle Transfer object created:', xfer);

  // Initiate the transfer on the source chain (Avalanche)
  console.log('Starting Transfer');
  const srcTxids = await xfer.initiateTransfer(source.signer);
  console.log(`Started Transfer: `, srcTxids);

  process.exit(0);
})();
    ```

### Run Automatic Transfer

Assuming you have created a new `automatic-transfer.ts` file for automatic transfers under the `src` directory, use the following command to run it with `ts-node`:

```bash
npx ts-node src/automatic-transfer.ts
```

The automatic relayer will take care of fetching the attestation and completing the transfer for you.
