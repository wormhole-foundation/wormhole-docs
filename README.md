Or plainly spoken - this is a very complex piece of software that targets a bleeding-edge, experimental smart contract runtime. Mistakes happen, and no matter how hard you try and whether you pay someone to audit it, it may eat your tokens, set your printer on fire, or startle your cat. Cryptocurrencies are a high-risk investment, no matter how fancy.
