# Message and Payload Structure

To enable secure and flexible cross-chain token transfers, the [Token Bridge](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank} defines a set of standardized payloads. These payloads are embedded in [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} and processed by bridge contracts on the source and destination chains. Each payload has a unique format and serves a specific role in the lifecycle of token bridging.

This page outlines each payload type in detail.

## Transfer

The `Transfer` payload (ID = `1`) is the core mechanism for moving tokens across chains. It is emitted when a user locks or burns tokens on the source chain. On the destination chain, it instructs the bridge to either mint a wrapped token or release native tokens from custody.

```text
PayloadID uint8 = 1
Amount uint256
TokenAddress bytes32
TokenChain uint16
To bytes32
ToChain uint16
Fee uint256
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `PayloadID` ++"uint8"++

    Value must be `1`, indicating a `Transfer` operation.

    ---

    `Amount` ++"uint256"++

    Amount being transferred, truncated to 8 decimals for consistency across all chains.

    ---

    `TokenAddress` ++"bytes32"++

    Address of the token. Left-zero-padded if shorter than 32 bytes
    
    ---

    `TokenChain` ++"uint16"++

    Chain ID of the token.
    
    ---

    `To` ++"bytes32"++

    Address of the recipient. Left-zero-padded if shorter than 32 bytes.
    
    ---

    `ToChain` ++"uint16"++

    Chain ID of the recipient.
    
    ---

    `Fee` ++"uint256"++

    Amount of tokens that the user is willing to pay as relayer fee. Must be less than Amount. Optional and can be claimed by relayers who submit the VAA on the target chain.
   

To keep `Transfer` messages small, they don't carry all the token's metadata. However, this means that before a token can be transferred to a new chain for the first time, the metadata needs to be bridged, and the wrapped asset needs to be created. Metadata, in this case, includes the number of decimals, which is a core requirement for instantiating a token.

## AssetMeta

Before a token can be transferred to a new chain for the first time, its metadata must be attested using the `AssetMeta` payload (ID = `2`). This ensures proper decimal precision and display.

```text
PayloadID uint8 = 2
TokenAddress [32]uint8
TokenChain uint16
Decimals uint8
Symbol [32]uint8
Name [32]uint8
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `PayloadID` ++"uint8"++

    Value must be `2`, indicating a `AssetMeta` operation.

    ---

    `TokenAddress` ++"[32]uint8"++

    Address of the token. Left-zero-padded if shorter than 32 bytes.

    ---

    `TokenChain` ++"uint16"++

    Chain ID of the token.

    ---

    `Decimals` ++"uint8"++

    Number of decimals the token uses on its native chain (not truncated to 8).

    ---

    `Symbol` ++"[32]uint8"++

    Symbol of the token, UTF-8 encoded and padded to 32 bytes.

    ---

    `Name` ++"[32]uint8"++

    Name of the token, UTF-8 encoded and padded to 32 bytes.

## TransferWithPayload

The `TransferWithPayload` payload (ID = `3`) extends the standard token transfer by allowing developers to include arbitrary data. This enables interactions with destination chain smart contracts, such as triggering swaps or staking.

```text
PayloadID uint8 = 3
Amount uint256
TokenAddress bytes32
TokenChain uint16
To bytes32
ToChain uint16
FromAddress bytes32
Payload bytes
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `PayloadID` ++"uint8"++

    Value must be `3`, indicating a `TransferWithPayload` operation.

    ---

    `Amount` ++"uint256"++

    Amount being transferred, truncated to 8 decimals.

    ---

    `TokenAddress` ++"bytes32"++

    Address of the token. Left-zero-padded if shorter than 32 bytes. 

    ---

    `TokenChain` ++"uint16"++

    Chain ID of the token.

    ---

    `To` ++"bytes32"++

    Address of the recipient. Must be a contract capable of parsing and handling the payload. Left-zero-padded if shorter than 32 bytes

    ---

    `ToChain` ++"uint16"++

    Chain ID of the recipient.

    ---

    `FromAddress` ++"bytes32"++

    Address of the sender on the source chain.

    ---

    `Payload` ++"bytes"++

    Arbitrary data passed to the recipient contract. Can be used for DeFi operations, authentication, or app-specific logic.


Unlike `Transfer`, the `TransferWithPayload` message must be redeemed by the recipient contract since only that contract can handle the custom payload properly.

## RegisterChain

The `RegisterChain` governance payload (Action ID = `1`) registers a Token Bridge emitter address for a foreign chain. This ensures the bridge only accepts messages from known peers.

```text
Module [32]byte
Action uint8 = 1
ChainId uint16

EmitterChainID uint16
EmitterAddress [32]uint8
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `Module` ++"[32]byte"++

    Module identifier. Left-padded with `TokenBridge` for Token Bridge.

    ---

    `Action` ++"uint8"++

    Value must be `1`, indicating a `RegisterChain` operation.

    ---

    `ChainID` ++"uint16"++

    The chain where this governance action should be applied. `0` is a valid value for all chains

    ---

    `EmitterChainID` ++"uint16"++

    Chain ID of the registered emitter.

    ---

    `EmitterAddress` ++"[32]uint8"++

    Address of the registered emitter, left-zero-padded if shorter than 32 bytes.

This payload can only be emitted by the Wormhole governance contract, ensuring that each chain accepts messages only from one verified bridge emitter per remote chain.

## UpgradeContract

The `UpgradeContract` governance payload (Action ID = `2`) facilitates upgrades to the Token Bridge contract on a specific chain.

```text
Module [32]byte
Action uint8 = 2
ChainId uint16

NewContract [32]uint8
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `Module` ++"[32]byte"++

    Module identifier, left-padded with `TokenBridge` for Token Bridge.

    ---

    `Action` ++"uint8"++

    Value must be `2`, indicating an `UpgradeContract` operation.

    ---

    `ChainID` ++"uint16"++

    The target chain where the governance action should be applied.

    ---

    `NewContract` ++"[32]uint8"++

    Address of the new Token Bridge contract, left-zero-padded to 32 bytes.

This message allows the Wormhole governance system to deploy new versions of the bridge while retaining control over interoperability and security.

# Flow of a Transfer

## Introduction

The [Wormhole Token Bridge](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank} enables token transfers across blockchains by combining token-specific logic with [Wormhole's core messaging layer](/docs/protocol/architecture/){target=\_blank}. Each supported chain runs its own Token Bridge contract, which manages actions like locking, burning, minting, and releasing tokens. These contracts communicate directly with Wormhole's core message-passing layer to securely transmit messages between chains.

This guide provides a conceptual overview of the Token Bridge and its integration with the messaging layer. It outlines each step of the transfer flow and explains how different transfer types work in practice.

## Transfer Flow

Cross-chain token transfers using the Token Bridge follow these steps:

1. **Initiation on the Source Chain**  
    The transfer begins when a user calls the Token Bridge contract on the source chain:

    - **Wrapped tokens**: The token is burned.
    - **Original tokens**: If the token is native to the source chain, the token is locked in the contract.

2. **Transfer Message Publication**  
    The Token Bridge contract invokes the Wormhole [Core Contract](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank}, which emits an on-chain message event describing the transfer.

3. **Message Observation and Signing**  
    [Guardians](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank}—a decentralized network of validators—monitor the source chain for these message events. A supermajority (13 out of 19) signs the event to generate a [Verified Action Approval (VAA)](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}—a cryptographically signed attestation of the transfer.

    The VAA is then published to the Wormhole network.

4. **VAA Submission to the Destination Chain**  
    The VAA must be submitted to the Token Bridge contract on the destination chain to complete the transfer. The Token Bridge contract then verifies the VAA by calling the Core Contract behind the scenes. This step can be handled in two ways:

    - **Automatic**: A relayer service detects the VAA and submits it to the Token Bridge contract.
    - **Manual**: The user or dApp retrieves the VAA and submits it directly to the Token Bridge contract.

5. **Finalization of the Transfer on the Destination Chain**  
   After the VAA is verified on the destination chain, the Token Bridge contract completes the transfer:

    - **Wrapped tokens**: A wrapped representation of the original token is minted.
    - **Original tokens**: If the token is native to the destination chain, the token is released to the recipient.

Consider this example: Alice wants to send 5 ETH from Ethereum to Solana. The ETH is locked on Ethereum’s Token Bridge, and an equivalent amount of wrapped ETH is minted on Solana. The diagram below illustrates this transfer flow.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice as Alice
    participant TokenBridgeEth as Token Bridge Ethereum<br>(Source Chain)
    participant CoreEth as Core Contract Ethereum<br>(Source Chain)
    participant Guardians
    participant TokenBridgeSol as Token Bridge Solana<br>(Destination Chain)
    participant CoreSol as Core Contract Solana<br>(Destination Chain)

    Alice->>TokenBridgeEth: Initiate ETH transfer<br>(lock ETH)
    TokenBridgeEth->>CoreEth: Publish transfer message
    CoreEth-->>Guardians: Emit message event
    Guardians->>Guardians: Sign and publish VAA

    alt Automatic VAA submission
        Guardians->>TokenBridgeSol: Relayer submits VAA
    else Manual VAA submission
        Alice->>Guardians: Retrieve VAA
        Alice->>TokenBridgeSol: Submit VAA
    end

    TokenBridgeSol->>CoreSol: Verify VAA
    CoreSol-->>TokenBridgeSol: VAA verified
    TokenBridgeSol-->>Alice: Mint wrapped ETH on Solana (complete transfer)
```

Maybe Alice wants to transfer her wrapped ETH on Solana back to native ETH on Ethereum. The wrapped ETH is burned on Solana’s Token Bridge, and the equivalent 5 ETH are released on Ethereum. The diagram below illustrates this transfer flow.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Alice
    participant TokenBridgeSrc as Token Bridge Solana<br>(Source Chain)
    participant CoreSrc as Core Contract Solana<br>(Source Chain)
    participant Guardians
    participant TokenBridgeDst as Token Bridge Ethereum<br>(Destination Chain)
    participant CoreDst as Core Contract Ethereum<br>(Destination Chain)

    User->>TokenBridgeSrc: Initiate transfer <br> (burn wrapped ETH)
    TokenBridgeSrc->>CoreSrc: Publish message
    CoreSrc-->>Guardians: Emit message event
    Guardians->>Guardians: Sign and publish VAA

    alt Automatic VAA submission
        Guardians->>TokenBridgeDst: Relayer submits VAA
    else Manual VAA submission
        User->>Guardians: Retrieve VAA
        User->>TokenBridgeDst: User submits VAA directly
    end

    TokenBridgeDst->>CoreDst: Verify VAA
    CoreDst-->>TokenBridgeDst: VAA verified
    TokenBridgeDst-->>User: Release native ETH on Ethereum (Complete transfer)
```


## Automatic vs. Manual Transfers

The Token Bridge supports two modes of transfer, depending on whether the VAA submission step is handled automatically or manually:

- **Automatic**: A relayer service listens for new VAAs and automatically submits them to the destination chain.
- **Manual**: The user (or dApp) must retrieve the VAA and manually submit it to the destination chain.

Here's a quick breakdown of the key differences:

| Feature                   | Automatic Transfer          | Manual Transfer                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Who submits the VAA?      | Relayer                     | User or dApp                        |
| User Experience           | Seamless, one-step          | Requires manual intervention        |
| Best for                  | End-users, simple UIs       | Custom dApps, advanced control      |
| Dependency                | Requires relayer support    | None                                |

### Completing Manual Transfers

The user who initiated the transfer should complete the transfer within 24 hours for manual transfers. Guardian Sets are guaranteed to be valid for at least that long. If a user waits longer, the Guardian Set may have changed between initiation and redemption, causing the VAA to be rejected.

If this occurs, follow the [Replace Outdated Signatures in VAAs](){target=_blank} tutorial to update the VAA with signatures from the current Guardian Set.

## Token Bridge Relayer (TBR)

When completing an automatic transfer using the Token Bridge—either through [Connect](/docs/products/connect/overview/){target=\_blank} or programmatically via the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](/docs/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/){target=\_blank}—the Token Bridge Relayer (TBR) manages the interaction with the underlying Token Bridge contracts on [supported chains where the TBR is available](/docs/products/connect/reference/support-matrix/){target=\_blank}.

<!-- TODO: add link to supported chains for TBR, pull this data in from the SDK and add it to the Token Bridge reference section. Eventually remove link to connect matrix -->

### Flow of an Automatic Transfer via TBR

The flow of an automatic transfer using the TBR looks like this:

1. **Initiation on the Source Chain**  
    The transfer begins when a user initiates a transfer on the source chain, which results in the TBR contract being called.

2. **Prepare and Forward the Transfer**  
    The TBR verifies the token, encodes transfer details (relayer fee, native gas request, recipient), and forwards the transfer to the Token Bridge.

3. **Core Messaging Layer Processes the Transfer**  
    The Token Bridge emits a message to the Core Contract. Guardians observe the message and produce a signed VAA attesting to the transfer. 

4. **Off-Chain Relayer Observes the VAA**

    An off-chain relayer verifies the destination chain and token registration and then prepares to complete the transfer.

5. **Relayer Computes Native Drop-Off and Submits the VAA** 

    The relayer queries the destination TBR for the native gas amount, includes it in the transaction, and submits the signed VAA.

6. **TBR Validates and Completes the Transfer**
    
    The destination TBR validates the VAA by invoking the Token Bridge contract, confirms it's from a registered TBR, verifies the token and native gas request, and then takes custody of the tokens.

6. **Asset Distribution on the Destination Chain**

    The TBR sends the remaining tokens and native gas to the user, pays the off-chain relayer fee, and refunds any excess native tokens.

The following diagram illustrates the key steps on the source chain during a transfer:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SourceTBR as Source Chain TBR
    participant SourceTB as Source Chain Token Bridge
    participant Messaging as Core Messaging Layer

    User->>SourceTBR: Initiate transfer (token, <br>recipient, fees, native gas)
    SourceTBR->>SourceTB: Forward transfer (burn or lock tokens)
    SourceTB->>Messaging: Publish transfer message
```

Once the core messaging layer processes the transfer, the destination chain handles completion as shown below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Messaging as Core Messaging Layer
    participant Relayer as Off-chain Relayer
    participant DestTBR as Destination Chain TBR
    participant DestTB as Destination Chain <br> Token Bridge
    participant DestUser as User <br> (Destination Chain)

    Messaging->>Relayer: Emit signed VAA for transfer
    Relayer->>Relayer: Verifies destination chain and token registration
    Relayer->>DestTBR: Query native gas amount
    Relayer->>DestTBR: Submit signed VAA
    DestTBR->>DestTB: Validate VAA
    DestTBR->>DestTBR: Take custody of tokens
    DestTBR->>DestUser: Send tokens (after fees & native gas)
    DestTBR->>Relayer: Pay relayer fee & refund excess
```

# FAQs

## Can ownership of wrapped tokens be transferred from the Token Bridge?

No, you cannot transfer ownership of wrapped token contracts from the [Token Bridge](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank} because the Token Bridge deploys and retains ownership of these contracts and tokens.

 - **On EVM chains** - when you attest a token, the Token Bridge deploys a new ERC-20 contract as a beacon proxy. The upgrade authority for these contracts is the Token Bridge contract itself
 - **On Solana** - the Token Bridge deploys a new SPL token, where the upgrade authority is a Program Derived Address (PDA) controlled by the Token Bridge

The logic behind deploying these token contracts involves submitting an attestation VAA, which allows the Token Bridge to verify and deploy the wrapped token contract on the destination chain.

Relevant contracts:

 - [Ethereum ERC-20](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/bridge/token/Token.sol){target=\_blank}
 - [Solana SPL](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/solana/modules/token_bridge/program/src/api/create_wrapped.rs#L128-L145){target=\_blank}
 - [Attestation VAA and Token Contract Deployment Logic](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/bridge/Bridge.sol#L385-L431){target=\_blank}

## How do I update the metadata of a wrapped token?

Because wrapped tokens are deployed and controlled by the Token Bridge program, which is under the authority of the Wormhole Guardians, there is no direct way for you to update their metadata. Instead, you must coordinate with the respective block explorer teams to request and apply metadata changes.

## How do I calculate the current gas costs for Ethereum Mainnet VAA verification?

You can refer to the [core-bridge repository](https://github.com/nonergodic/core-bridge){target=\_blank} for guidance on how to calculate the current gas costs associated with verifying VAAs on Ethereum Mainnet. This repository provides up-to-date references and examples to help you gauge costs accurately.

## How can I update my wrapped token image on Solscan?

Updating the metadata (such as the token image, name, or symbol) of a wrapped token on [Solscan](https://solscan.io/){target=\_blank} requires [contacting the Solscan team](https://solscan.io/contactus){target=\_blank} directly. Wormhole cannot make these updates for you because the wrapped token contracts are owned and controlled by the Token Bridge, not individual developers or projects.

To request an update, contact Solscan via [support@solscan.io](mailto:support@solscan.io) or their [contact form](https://solscan.io/contactus){target=\_blank}.

# Get Started with Token Bridge

## Introduction

Wormhole's [Token Bridge](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview){target=\_blank} enables seamless multichain token transfers by locking tokens on a source chain and minting equivalent wrapped tokens on a destination chain. This mechanism preserves token properties such as name, symbol, and decimal precision across chains.

In this guide, you will use the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank} to perform two types of transfers. <!-- If you're new to transfer modes, see the [Transfer Modes page](TODO){target=\_blank} for a detailed explanation. commenting because we don't have this page-->

 - **Manual transfer**: Where you control each step.
 - **Automatic transfer**: Where a relayer finalizes the transfer for you.

These examples will help you understand how the Token Bridge works across EVM and non-EVM chains.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

 - [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank}
 - Wallets funded with tokens on two [supported chains](/docs/products/reference/supported-networks/#token-bridge){target=\_blank}

This guide uses a Solana wallet with [devnet SOL](https://faucet.solana.com/){target=\_blank} and an EVM wallet with [Sepolia ETH](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia){target=\_blank} for the manual transfer example, and [Avalanche Fuji](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c){target=\_blank} and [Celo Alfajores](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores){target=\_blank} wallets funded with testnet tokens for the automatic transfer. You can adapt the examples to match your preferred chains.

## Configure Your Token Transfer Environment

1. Create a new directory and initialize a Node.js project:

    ```bash
    mkdir token-bridge
    cd token-bridge
    npm init -y
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk
    npm install -D tsx typescript
    ```

3. Create a `transfer.ts` file to handle the multichain transfer logic, and a `helper.ts` file to manage wallet signers and token utilities:

    ```bash
    touch transfer.ts helper.ts
    ```

4. Set up secure access to your wallets. This guide assumes you are loading your `SOL_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` from a secure keystore of your choice, such as a secrets manager or a CLI-based tool like [`cast wallet`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-wallet){target=\_blank}.

    !!! warning
        If you use a `.env` file during development, add it to your `.gitignore` to exclude it from version control. Never commit private keys or mnemonics to your repository.

## Perform a Token Transfer

This section shows how to run manual and automatic token transfers using a shared project structure. You will define helper utilities once and reuse them across both flows.

In the manual transfer, you initiate a transfer on Solana, wait for Guardian signatures, and redeem the tokens on Sepolia, giving you complete control over each step. In the automatic transfer, the relayer handles attestation and redemption, simplifying the process between EVM chains.

1. Open `helper.ts` and define utility functions to load private keys, instantiate signers for Solana and EVM chains, and retrieve token decimals as needed:

    ```ts title="helper.ts"
    import {
  ChainAddress,
  ChainContext,
  Network,
  Signer,
  Wormhole,
  Chain,
  isTokenId,
  TokenId,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';

/**
 * Returns a signer for the given chain using locally scoped credentials.
 * The required values (EVM_PRIVATE_KEY, SOL_PRIVATE_KEY, SUI_MNEMONIC) must
 * be loaded securely beforehand, for example via a keystore, secrets
 * manager, or environment variables (not recommended).
 */
export async function getSigner<n c="" chain="" extends="" network,="">(
  chain: ChainContext<n, c="">
): Promise&lt;{
  chain: ChainContext<n, c="">;
  signer: Signer<n, c="">;
  address: ChainAddress<c>;
}&gt; {
  let signer: Signer;
  const platform = chain.platform.utils()._platform;

  switch (platform) {
    case 'Evm':
      signer = await (
        await evm()
      ).getSigner(await chain.getRpc(), EVM_PRIVATE_KEY!);
      break;
    case 'Solana':
      signer = await (
        await solana()
      ).getSigner(await chain.getRpc(), SOL_PRIVATE_KEY!);
      break;
    case 'Sui':
      signer = await (
        await sui()
      ).getSigner(await chain.getRpc(), SUI_MNEMONIC!);
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unsupported platform: ${platform}`);
  }

  return {
    chain,
    signer: signer as Signer<n, c="">,
    address: Wormhole.chainAddress(chain.chain, signer.address()),
  };
}

/**
 * Get the number of decimals for the token on the source chain.
 * This helps convert a user-friendly amount (e.g., '1') into raw units.
 */
export async function getTokenDecimals<n extends="" network="">(
  wh: Wormhole<n>,
  token: TokenId,
  chain: ChainContext<n, any="">
): Promise<number> {
  return isTokenId(token)
    ? Number(await wh.getDecimals(token.chain, token.address))
    : chain.config.nativeTokenDecimals;
}
</number></n,></n></n></n,></c></n,></n,></n,></n>
    ```

2. In `transfer.ts`, add the script for your preferred transfer mode. The `automatic` flag controls transfer behavior passed to `tokenTransfer()`; set it to `false` for manual transfers and `true` for automatic transfers

    === "Manual Transfer"

        ```ts title="transfer.ts"
        import { wormhole, amount, Wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import { getSigner, getTokenDecimals } from './helper';

(async function () {
  // Initialize Wormhole SDK for Solana and Sepolia on Testnet
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [solana, sui, evm]);

  // Define the source and destination chains
  const sendChain = wh.getChain('Solana');
  const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Sepolia');

  // Load signers and addresses from helpers
  const source = await getSigner(sendChain);
  const destination = await getSigner(rcvChain);

  // Define the token and amount to transfer
  const tokenId = Wormhole.tokenId('Solana', 'native');
  const amt = '0.1';

  // Convert to raw units based on token decimals
  const decimals = await getTokenDecimals(wh, tokenId, sendChain);
  const transferAmount = amount.units(amount.parse(amt, decimals));

  // Set to false to require manual approval steps
  const automatic = false;
  const nativeGas = automatic ? amount.units(amount.parse('0.0', 6)) : 0n;

  // Construct the transfer object
  const xfer = await wh.tokenTransfer(
    tokenId,
    transferAmount,
    source.address,
    destination.address,
    automatic,
    undefined,
    nativeGas
  );

  // Initiate the transfer from Solana
  console.log('Starting Transfer');
  const srcTxids = await xfer.initiateTransfer(source.signer);
  console.log(`Started Transfer: `, srcTxids);

  // Wait for the signed attestation from the Guardian network
  console.log('Fetching Attestation');
  const timeout = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
  await xfer.fetchAttestation(timeout);

  // Redeem the tokens on Sepolia
  console.log('Completing Transfer');
  const destTxids = await xfer.completeTransfer(destination.signer);
  console.log(`Completed Transfer: `, destTxids);

  process.exit(0);
})();
        ```
    
    === "Automatic Transfer"

        ```ts title="transfer.ts"
        import { wormhole, amount, Wormhole } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import solana from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/solana';
import sui from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/sui';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import { getSigner, getTokenDecimals } from './helper';

(async function () {
  // Initialize Wormhole SDK for Avalanche and Celo on Testnet
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [solana, sui, evm]);

  // Define the source and destination chains
  const sendChain = wh.getChain('Avalanche');
  const rcvChain = wh.getChain('Celo');

  // Load signers and addresses from helpers
  const source = await getSigner(sendChain);
  const destination = await getSigner(rcvChain);

  // Define the token and amount to transfer
  const tokenId = Wormhole.tokenId('Avalanche', 'native');
  const amt = '0.2';

  // Convert to raw units based on token decimals
  const decimals = await getTokenDecimals(wh, tokenId, sendChain);
  const transferAmount = amount.units(amount.parse(amt, decimals));

  // Set to false to require manual approval steps
  const automatic = true;
  const nativeGas = automatic ? amount.units(amount.parse('0.0', 6)) : 0n;

  // Construct the transfer object
  const xfer = await wh.tokenTransfer(
    tokenId,
    transferAmount,
    source.address,
    destination.address,
    automatic,
    undefined,
    nativeGas
  );

  // Initiate the transfer from Avalanche Fuji
  console.log('Starting Transfer');
  const srcTxids = await xfer.initiateTransfer(source.signer);
  console.log(`Started Transfer: `, srcTxids);

  process.exit(0);
})();
        ```


3. Execute the script to initiate and complete the transfer:

    ```bash
    npx tsx transfer.ts
    ```

    If successful, the expected output should be similar to this:

    <div data-termynal="" id="termynal">
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx transfer.ts</span>
<span data-ty="">Starting Transfer</span>

# Interact with Token Bridge Contracts

## Introduction 

Wormhole's Token Bridge enables seamless cross-chain token transfers using a lock-and-mint mechanism. The bridge locks tokens on the source chain and mints them as wrapped assets on the destination chain. Additionally, the Token Bridge supports [Token Transfers with Messages](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/#token-transfer-with-message){target=\_blank}, where arbitrary byte payloads can be attached to the token transfer, enabling more complex chain interactions. 

This page outlines the core contract methods needed to integrate Token Bridge functionality into your smart contracts. To understand the theoretical workings of the Token Bridge, refer to the [Token Bridge](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank} page in the Learn section. 

## Prerequisites

To interact with the Wormhole Token Bridge, you'll need the following:

- [The address of the Token Bridge contract](/docs/products/reference/contract-addresses/#token-bridge){target=\_blank} on the chains you're working with
- [The Wormhole chain ID](/docs/products/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} of the chains you're targeting for token transfers

## How to Interact with Token Bridge Contracts

The primary functions of the Token Bridge contracts revolve around:

- **Attesting a token** - registering a new token for cross-chain transfers
- **Transferring tokens** - locking and minting tokens across chains
- **Transferring tokens with a payload** - including additional data with transfers

### Attest a Token

Suppose a token has never been transferred to the target chain before transferring it cross-chain. In that case, its metadata must be registered so the Token Bridge can recognize it and create a wrapped version if necessary.

The attestation process doesn't require you to manually input token details like name, symbol, or decimals. Instead, the Token Bridge contract retrieves these values from the token contract itself when you call the `attestToken()` method.

```solidity
function attestToken(
    address tokenAddress,
    uint32 nonce
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `tokenAddress` ++"address"++
        
    The contract address of the token to be attested.

    ---

    `nonce` ++"uint32"++  

    An arbitrary value provided by the caller to ensure uniqueness.

??? interface "Returns"

    `sequence` ++"uint64"++
    
    A unique identifier for the attestation transaction.

??? interface "Example"

    ```solidity
    IWormhole wormhole = IWormhole(wormholeAddr);
ITokenBridge tokenBridge = ITokenBridge(tokenBridgeAddr);

uint256 wormholeFee = wormhole.messageFee();

tokenBridge.attestToken{value: wormholeFee}(
    address(tokenImpl), // the token contract to attest
    234                 // nonce for the transfer
);
    ```

When `attestToken()` is called, the contract emits a Verifiable Action Approval (VAA) containing the token's metadata, which the Guardians sign and publish.

You must ensure the token is ERC-20 compliant. If it does not implement the standard functions, the attestation may fail or produce incomplete metadata.

### Transfer Tokens 

Once a token is attested, a cross-chain token transfer can be initiated following the lock-and-mint mechanism. On the source chain, tokens are locked (or burned if they're already a wrapped asset), and a VAA is emitted. On the destination chain, that VAA is used to mint or release the corresponding amount of wrapped tokens.

Call `transferTokens()` to lock/burn tokens and produce a VAA with transfer details.

```solidity
function transferTokens(
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint16 recipientChain,
    bytes32 recipient,
    uint256 arbiterFee,
    uint32 nonce
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `token` ++"address"++
        
    The address of the token being transferred.

    ---

    `amount` ++"uint256"++  
    The amount of tokens to be transferred.

    ---

    `recipientChain` ++"uint16"++  
    The Wormhole chain ID of the destination chain.

    ---

    `recipient` ++"bytes32"++  
    The recipient's address on the destination chain.

    ---

    `arbiterFee` ++"uint256"++  
    Optional fee to be paid to an arbiter for relaying the transfer.

    ---

    `nonce` ++"uint32"++  
    A unique identifier for the transaction.

??? interface "Returns"

    `sequence` ++"uint64"++
    
    A unique identifier for the transfer transaction.

??? interface "Example"

    ```solidity
    IWormhole wormhole = IWormhole(wormholeAddr);
ITokenBridge tokenBridge = ITokenBridge(tokenBridgeAddr);

// Get the fee for publishing a message
uint256 wormholeFee = wormhole.messageFee();

tokenBridge.transferTokens{value: wormholeFee}(
    token,           // address of the ERC-20 token to transfer
    amount,          // amount of tokens to transfer
    recipientChain,  // Wormhole chain ID of the destination chain
    recipient,       // recipient address on the destination chain (as bytes32)
    arbiterFee,      // fee for relayer
    nonce            // nonce for this transfer
);
    ```

Once a transfer VAA is obtained from the Wormhole Guardian network, the final step is to redeem the tokens on the destination chain. Redemption verifies the VAA's authenticity and releases (or mints) tokens to the specified recipient. To redeem the tokens, call `completeTransfer()`.

```solidity
function completeTransfer(bytes memory encodedVm) external;
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `encodedVm` ++"bytes memory"++
    
    The signed VAA containing the transfer details.

!!!note
    - The Token Bridge normalizes token amounts to 8 decimals when passing them between chains. Make sure your application accounts for potential decimal truncation
    - The VAA ensures the integrity of the message. Only after the Guardians sign the VAA can it be redeemed on the destination chain

### Transfer Tokens with Payload

While a standard token transfer moves tokens between chains, a transfer with a payload allows you to embed arbitrary data in the VAA. This data can be used on the destination chain to execute additional logic—such as automatically depositing tokens into a DeFi protocol, initiating a swap on a DEX, or interacting with a custom smart contract.

Call `transferTokensWithPayload()` instead of `transferTokens()` to include a custom payload (arbitrary bytes) with the token transfer.

```solidity
function transferTokensWithPayload(
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint16 recipientChain,
    bytes32 recipient,
    uint32 nonce,
    bytes memory payload
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `token` ++"address"++
    
    The address of the token being transferred.

    ---

    `amount` ++"uint256"++  
    The amount of tokens to be transferred.

    ---

    `recipientChain` ++"uint16"++  
    The Wormhole chain ID of the destination chain.

    ---

    `recipient` ++"bytes32"++  
    The recipient's address on the destination chain.

    ---

    `nonce` ++"uint32"++  
    A unique identifier for the transaction.

    ---

    `payload` ++"bytes memory"++  
    Arbitrary data payload attached to the transaction.

??? interface "Returns"
    
    `sequence` ++"uint64"++
    
    A unique identifier for the transfer transaction.

??? interface "Example"

    ```solidity
    IWormhole wormhole = IWormhole(wormholeAddr);
ITokenBridge tokenBridge = ITokenBridge(tokenBridgeAddr);

// Get the fee for publishing a message
uint256 wormholeFee = wormhole.messageFee();

tokenBridge.transferTokensWithPayload{value: wormholeFee}(
    token,           // address of the ERC-20 token to transfer
    amount,          // amount of tokens to transfer
    recipientChain,  // Wormhole chain ID of the destination chain
    recipient,       // recipient address on the destination chain (as bytes32)
    nonce,           // nonce for this transfer
    additionalPayload // additional payload data
);
    ```

After initiating a transfer on the source chain, the Wormhole Guardian network observes and signs the resulting message, creating a Verifiable Action Approval (VAA). You'll need to fetch this VAA and then call `completeTransferWithPayload()`.

Only the designated recipient contract can redeem tokens. This ensures that the intended contract securely handles the attached payload. On successful redemption, the tokens are minted (if foreign) or released (if native) to the recipient address on the destination chain. For payload transfers, the designated contract can execute the payload's logic at this time.

```solidity
function completeTransferWithPayload(bytes memory encodedVm) external returns (bytes memory);
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `encodedVm` ++"bytes memory"++

    The signed VAA containing the transfer details.

??? interface "Returns"

    `bytes memory`

    The extracted payload data.

# Transfer Wrapped Assets

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the transfer of wrapped assets using the core Token Bridge protocol via the TypeScript SDK. This example will transfer an arbitrary ERC-20 token from Moonbase Alpha to Ethereum Sepolia but can be adapted for any supported EVM chains. View this list of chains with [deployed Token Bridge contracts](/products/reference/contract-addresses/#token-bridge){target=\_blank} to verify if your desired source and destination chains are supported.

Completing this guide will help you to accomplish the following:

- Verify if a wrapped version of a token exists on a destination chain
- Create a token attestation to register a wrapped version of a token on a destination chain
- Transfer wrapped assets using Token Bridge manual transfer
- Fetch a signed Verified Action Approval (VAA)
- Manually redeem a signed VAA to claim tokens on a destination chain

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank} installed on your machine
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/){target=\_blank} installed globally
- The contract address for the ERC-20 token you wish to transfer
- A wallet setup with the following:
  - Private keys for your source and destination chains
  - A small amount of gas tokens on your source and destination chains
  - A balance on your source chain of the ERC-20 token you want to transfer

## Set Up Your Token Transfer Environment

Follow these steps to initialize your project, install dependencies, and prepare your developer environment for multichain token transfers.

1. Create a new directory and initialize a Node.js project using the following commands:
   ```bash
   mkdir token-bridge-demo
   cd token-bridge-demo
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install dependencies, including the Wormhole TypeScript SDK:
   ```bash
   npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk ethers -D tsx typescript
   ```

3. Set up secure access to your wallets. This guide assumes you are loading your private key values from a secure keystore of your choice, such as a secrets manager or a CLI-based tool like [`cast wallet`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-wallet){target=\_blank}.

    !!! warning
        If you use a `.env` file during development, add it to your `.gitignore` to exclude it from version control. Never commit private keys or mnemonics to your repository.

4. Create an `src` directory, navigate into it, then create a new file named `helpers.ts` to hold signer functions:
   ```bash
   mkdir src && cd src
   touch helpers.ts
   ```

5. Open `helpers.ts` and add the following code:
    ```typescript title="helpers.ts"
    import { getEvmSigner } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

/**
 * Returns a signer for the given chain using locally scoped credentials.
 * The required values (MOONBEAM_PRIVATE_KEY, SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY) must
 * be loaded securely beforehand, for example via a keystore, secrets
 * manager, or environment variables (not recommended).
 */
// Use a custom RPC or fallback to public endpoints
const MOONBEAM_RPC_URL =
  process.env.MOONBEAM_RPC_URL! || 'https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network';
const SEPOLIA_RPC_URL =
  process.env.SEPOLIA_RPC_URL! || 'https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io';

// Define raw ethers.Wallets for contract runner interactions
export function getMoonbeamWallet(): ethers.Wallet {
  return new ethers.Wallet(
    MOONBEAM_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(MOONBEAM_RPC_URL)
  );
}
export function getSepoliaWallet(): ethers.Wallet {
  return new ethers.Wallet(
    SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(SEPOLIA_RPC_URL)
  );
}

// Create Wormhole-compatible signer for SDK interactions
export async function getMoonbeamSigner() {
  const wallet = getMoonbeamWallet(); // Wallet
  const provider = wallet.provider as ethers.JsonRpcProvider; // Provider
  return await getEvmSigner(provider, wallet, { chain: 'Moonbeam' });
}

export async function getSepoliaSigner() {
  const wallet = getSepoliaWallet();
  const provider = wallet.provider as ethers.JsonRpcProvider;
  return await getEvmSigner(provider, wallet, { chain: 'Sepolia' });
}
    ```

### Wormhole Signer versus Ethers Wallet

When working with the Wormhole SDK on EVM-compatible chains, developers often encounter two types of signers:

- [**`Signer`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/a86f8f93953cdb67ba26c78435b9d539282065f2/core/definitions/src/signer.ts#L12){target=\_blank}: a Wormhole compatible signer designed to be compatible with the Wormhole SDK abstractions, particularly for transaction batching and message parsing. Use the Wormhole `Signer` when:
    - Passing a signer into Wormhole SDK helper methods, like `signSendWait()`
    - Creating or submitting transactions using `TokenBridge`, `CoreBridge`, or other Wormhole protocol modules
    - Calling methods that require Wormhole's internal `Signer` type, which can be a `SignOnlySigner` or `SignAndSendSigner`

- [**`ethers.Wallet`**](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/wallet/){target=\_blank} from Ethers.js: Wormhole's `Signer` often doesn't expose low-level methods like `sendTransaction()`, which you might need for manual control. Use the Ethers `Wallet` when:
    - You need to manually sign and send EVM transactions (`wallet.sendTransaction()`)
    - You're interacting directly with smart contracts using `ethers.Contract`
    - You want complete control over gas, nonce, or transaction composition

## Verify Token Registration (Attestation)

Tokens must be registered on the destination chain before they can be bridged. This process includes submitting an attestation with the native token metadata to the destination chain. This attestation allows the destination chain Token Bridge contract to create a corresponding wrapped version with the same attributes as the native token.

Registration via attestation is only required the first time a given token is sent to that specific destination chain. Your transfer script should include a check for an existing wrapped version of the token on your destination chain. Follow these steps to check the registration status of a token:

1. Inside your `src` directory, create a new file named `transfer.ts`:
   ```bash
   touch transfer.ts
   ```

2. Open your `transfer.ts` file and add the following code:
    ```typescript title="transfer.ts"
    wormhole,
  toNative,
  toUniversal,
  serialize,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import {
  getMoonbeamSigner,
  getMoonbeamWallet,
  getSepoliaSigner,
  getSepoliaWallet,
} from './helpers';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { writeFile } from 'fs/promises';

async function transferTokens() {
  // Initialize Wormhole SDK with EVM support
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm]);
  // Get source and destination chain contexts
  const sourceChainCtx = wh.getChain('Moonbeam');
  const destinationChainCtx = wh.getChain('Sepolia');
  /** Get signers, wallets, and addresses for source and destination chains
   * Signers: Wormhole-compatible signers for SDK interactions
   * Wallets: Raw ethers.Wallets for contract interactions
   * Addresses: EVM addresses that won't trigger ENS resolve errors
   * */
  const sourceSigner = await getMoonbeamSigner();
  const sourceWallet = await getMoonbeamWallet();
  const destinationSigner = await getSepoliaSigner();
  const destinationWallet = await getSepoliaWallet();
  const sourceAddress = await sourceSigner.address();
  const destinationAddress = ethers.getAddress(
    await destinationSigner.address()
  );
  if (typeof destinationAddress !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Destination address must be a string');
  }

  // Define the ERC-20 token and amount to transfer
  // Replace with contract address of the ERC-20 token to transfer
  const ERC20_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS';
  const tokenAddress = toNative('Moonbeam', ERC20_ADDRESS);
  const amount = '0.01';
  // Get the Token Bridge protocol for source chain
  const tokenBridge = await sourceChainCtx.getProtocol('TokenBridge');
  // Check source wallet balance of the ERC-20 token to transfer
  const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(
    tokenAddress.toString(),
    [
      'function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)',
      'function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) returns (bool)',
      'function decimals() view returns (uint8)',
    ],
    sourceWallet
  );
  const tokenBalance = await tokenContract.balanceOf(sourceAddress);
  // Get the decimals from the token metadata
  const decimals = await tokenContract.decimals();
  // Convert the amount to BigInt for comparison
  const amountBigInt = BigInt(ethers.parseUnits(amount, decimals).toString());
  const humanBalance = ethers.formatUnits(tokenBalance, decimals);
  console.log(`💰 ERC-20 balance: ${humanBalance}`);

  if (tokenBalance &lt; amountBigInt) {
    throw new Error(
      `🚫 Insufficient ERC-20 balance. Have ${humanBalance}, need ${amount}`
    );
  }

  // Check if token is registered with the destination chain token bridge
  const destinationTokenBridge = await destinationChainCtx.getTokenBridge();
  const isRegistered = await destinationTokenBridge.hasWrappedAsset({
    chain: sourceChainCtx.chain,
    address: tokenAddress.toUniversalAddress(),
  });
  // If it isn't registered, prompt user to attest the token
  if (!isRegistered) {
    console.log(`🚫 Token not registered on ${destinationChainCtx.chain}.`);
    console.log(
      `👉 Open attestToken.ts, define the token address, and run npx tsx attest:token`
    );
    return;
    // If it is registered, proceed with transfer
  } else {
    console.log(
      `✅ Token is registered on ${destinationChainCtx.chain}. Proceeding with transfer...`
    );
  }

// Additional transfer code
    console.error('❌ Error in transferViaAutoBridge:', e);
  process.exit(1);
});
    ```

    This code does the following:

    - Initializes a `wormhole` instance and defines the source and destination chains
    - Imports the signer and wallet functions from `helpers.ts`
    - Identifies the token to transfer and verifies the token balance in the source wallet
    - Gets the `TokenBridge` protocol client for the source chain
    - Checks to see if a wrapped version of the ERC-20 token to transfer exists on the destination chain

3.  Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx tsx transfer.ts
    ```

    If the token is registered on the destination chain, the address of the existing wrapped asset is returned, and you can continue to [initiate the transfer](#initiate-transfer-on-source-chain) on the source chain. If the token is not registered, you will see a message similar to the following advising attestation is required:

    <div data-termynal="" id="termynal">
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx src/transfer.ts</span>
<span data-ty="">💰 ERC-20 balance: 1000000.0</span>
<span data-ty="">🚫 Token not registered on Sepolia.</span>
<span data-ty="">👉 Open attestToken.ts, define the token address, and run npx tsx attestToken.ts.</span>
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

    ??? example "Need to register a token?"
        Token attestation is a one-time process to register a token on a destination chain. You should only follow these steps if your token registration check indicates a wrapped version does not exist on the destination chain.

        1. Inside the `src` directory, create a new file named `attestToken.ts`:

            ```bash
            touch attestToken.ts
            ```

        2. Open the new file and add the following code:

            ```typescript title="attestToken.ts"
            import { wormhole, toNative } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import {
  getMoonbeamSigner,
  getMoonbeamWallet,
  getSepoliaSigner,
  getSepoliaWallet,
} from './helpers';

async function attestToken() {
  // Initialize the Wormhole SDK, get chain contexts
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm]);
  const sourceChainCtx = wh.getChain('Moonbeam');
  const destinationChainCtx = wh.getChain('Sepolia');
  // Get signers for source and destination chains
  const sourceSigner = await getMoonbeamSigner();
  const sourceWallet = getMoonbeamWallet();
  const destinationSigner = await getSepoliaSigner();
  const destinationWallet = await getSepoliaWallet();

  // Define the token to attest for registeration
  // on the destination chain (token you want to transfer)
  const tokenToAttest = 'INSERT_TOKEN_ADDRESS';
  const token = toNative(sourceChainCtx.chain, tokenToAttest);
  console.log(`🔍 Token to attest: ${token.toString()}`);

  // Get the Token Bridge protocol for source chain
  const sourceTokenBridge = await sourceChainCtx.getTokenBridge();
  // Create attestation transactions
  const createAttestationTxs = sourceTokenBridge.createAttestation(token);
  // Prepare to collect transaction hashes
  const sourceTxids: string[] = [];
  // Iterate through the unsigned transactions, sign and send them
  for await (const tx of createAttestationTxs) {
    const txRequest = tx.transaction as ethers.TransactionRequest;
    const sentTx = await sourceWallet.sendTransaction(txRequest); // Use wallet, not SDK signer
    await sentTx.wait();
    sourceTxids.push(sentTx.hash);
  }
  const sourceTxId = sourceTxids[0];
  console.log(`✅ Attestation tx sent: ${sourceTxId}`);
  // Parse the transaction to get messages
  const messages = await sourceChainCtx.parseTransaction(sourceTxId);
  console.log('📦 Parsed messages:', messages);
  // Set a timeout for fetching the VAA, this can take several minutes
  // depending on the source chain network and finality
  const timeout = 25 * 60 * 1000;
  // Fetch the VAA for the attestation message
  const vaa = await wh.getVaa(messages[0]!, 'TokenBridge:AttestMeta', timeout);
  if (!vaa) throw new Error('❌ VAA not found before timeout.');

  console.log(
    `📨 Submitting attestation VAA to ${destinationChainCtx.chain}...`
  );
  // Get the Token Bridge protocol for destination chain
  const destTokenBridge = await destinationChainCtx.getTokenBridge();
  // Submit the attestation VAA
  const submitTxs = destTokenBridge.submitAttestation(vaa);
  // Prepare to collect transaction hashes for the destination chain
  const destTxids: string[] = [];
  // Iterate through the unsigned transactions, sign and send them
  for await (const tx of submitTxs) {
    const txRequest = tx.transaction as ethers.TransactionRequest;
    const sentTx = await destinationWallet.sendTransaction(txRequest);
    await sentTx.wait();
    destTxids.push(sentTx.hash);
  }
  console.log(`✅ Attestation VAA submitted: ${destTxids[0]}`);
  console.log(
    `🎉 Token attestation complete! You are now ready to transfer ${token.toString()} to ${
      destinationChainCtx.chain
    }`
  );
}

attestToken().catch((err) =&gt; {
  console.error('❌ Error in attestToken:', err);
  process.exit(1);
});
            ```

            This code does the following:
        
            - Initializes a `wormhole` instance and defines the source and destination chains for the transfer 
            - Imports your signer and wallet functions from `helpers.ts`
            - Identifies the token to attest for registration on the destination chain
            - Gets the Token Bridge protocol for the source chain and sends the `createAttestation` transaction there
            - Waits for the signed VAA confirming the attestation creation
            - Sends the VAA to the destination chain to complete registration

        3. Run the script with the following command:
            
            ```bash
            npx tsx attestToken.ts
            ```

            When the attestation and registration are complete, you will see terminal output similar to the following:

            <div data-termynal="" id="termynal">
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx src/attestToken.ts</span>
<span data-ty="">🔍 Token to attest: 0x39F2f26f247CcC223393396755bfde5ecaeb0648</span>
<span data-ty="">✅ Attestation tx sent: 0x8e56fd1e5a539127542e087e5618ccc5b315cf5cefcd7763b8dbeefa67eec370</span>
<span data-ty="">📦 Parsed messages: [

    sequence: 1497n
  }
]</span>
<span data-ty=""></span>
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

        You can now go on to [initiate the transfer](#initiate-transfer-on-source-chain) on the source chain.

## Initiate Transfer on Source Chain

Follow these steps to add the rest of the logic to initiate the token transfer on the source chain:

1. Open your `transfer.ts` file and replace the commented line "// Additional transfer code" with the following code:

    ```typescript title="transfer.ts"
    const tokenBridgeAddress = "INSERT_TOKEN_BRIDGE_ADDRESS"; // e.g., "0xYourTokenBridgeAddress"
// Approve the Token Bridge to spend your ERC-20 token
const approveTx = await tokenContract.approve(tokenBridgeAddress, amountBigInt);
await approveTx.wait();
console.log(`✅ Approved Token Bridge to spend ${amount} ERC-20 token.`);

// Build transfer transactions
const transferTxs = await tokenBridge.transfer(
toNative(sourceChainCtx.chain, sourceAddress),
{
chain: destinationChainCtx.chain,
address: toUniversal(destinationChainCtx.chain, await destinationSigner.address),
},
tokenAddress,
amountBigInt
);
// Gather transaction IDs for each transfer
const txids: string[] = [];
// Iterate through each unsigned transaction, sign and send it,
// and collect the transaction IDs
for await (const unsignedTx of transferTxs) {
const tx = unsignedTx.transaction as ethers.TransactionRequest;
const sentTx = await sourceSigner.sendTransaction(tx);
await sentTx.wait();
txids.push(sentTx.hash);
}

console.log("✅ Sent txs:", txids);

// Parse the transaction to get Wormhole messages
const messages = await sourceChainCtx.parseTransaction(txids[0]!);
console.log("📨 Parsed transfer messages:", messages);
// Set a timeout for VAA retrieval
// This can take several minutes depending on the network and finality
const timeout = 25 _ 60 _ 1000; // 25 minutes
const vaaBytes = await wh.getVaa(messages[0]!, "TokenBridge:Transfer", timeout);

// Save VAA to file. You will need this to submit
// the transfer on the destination chain
if (!vaaBytes) {
throw new Error("❌ No VAA was returned. Token transfer may not have finalized yet.");
}
await writeFile("vaa.bin", Buffer.from(serialize(vaaBytes)));
console.log("📝 VAA saved to vaa.bin");
}
    ```

    This code does the following:

    - Uses the supplied [Token Bridge contract address](https://wormhole.com/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#token-bridge){target=\_blank} to approve spending the ERC-20 token in the amount you want to transfer
    - Calls the `transfer()` method to initiate the transfer on the source chain
    - Watches for the transaction, parses the transaction ID to read the Wormhole message, and waits for the Guardians to sign the VAA verifying the transaction
    - Fetches the VAA and writes it to a file named `vaa.bin`, which will be used to redeem the transfer and claim the tokens on the destination chain

2. Run the script with the following command:
    ```bash
    npx tsx transfer.ts
    ```

3. You will see terminal output similar to the following:

    <div data-termynal="" id="termynal">
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx src/transfer.ts</span>
<span data-ty="">✅ Token is registered on Sepolia. Proceeding with transfer...</span>
<span data-ty="">✅ Approved Token Bridge to spend 0.01 ERC-20 token.</span>

]</span>
<span data-ty="">📨 Parsed transfer messages: [
  {
    chain: 'Moonbeam',
    emitter: UniversalAddress { address: [Uint8Array] },
    sequence: 1498n
  }

<span data-ty="">Retrying Wormholescan:GetVaaBytes, attempt 1/750</span>
<span data-ty="">.....</span>
<span data-ty="">Retrying Wormholescan:GetVaaBytes, attempt 14/750</span>
<span data-ty="">📝 VAA saved to vaa.bin</span>
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

## Redeem Transfer on Destination Chain

The final step to complete a manual transfer with Token Bridge is to submit the signed VAA from your transfer transaction to the destination chain. The signed VAA provides Guardian-backed confirmation of the tokens locked in the token bridge contract on the source chain, allowing a matching amount of tokens to be minted on the destination chain. 

Follow these steps to redeem your transfer on the destination chain:

1. Inside the `src` directory, create a file named `redeem.ts`:
    ```bash
    touch redeem.ts
    ```

2. Open the file and add the following code:
    ```typescript title="redeem.ts"
    import { wormhole, toNative, VAA } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import { deserialize } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-definitions';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';
import { getSepoliaSigner, getSepoliaWallet } from './helpers';
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';

async function redeemOnDestination() {
  // Read the raw VAA bytes from file
  const vaaBytes = await fs.readFile('vaa.bin');
  // Initialize the Wormhole SDK
  const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm]);
  // Get the destination chain context
  const destinationChainCtx = wh.getChain('Sepolia');

  // Parse the VAA from bytes
  const vaa = deserialize(
    'TokenBridge:Transfer',
    vaaBytes
  ) as VAA&lt;'TokenBridge:Transfer'&gt;;

  // Get the signer for destination chain
  const destinationSigner = await getSepoliaSigner();
  const destinationWallet = await getSepoliaWallet();
  const recipient = destinationSigner.address();

  // Get the TokenBridge protocol for the destination chain
  const tokenBridge = await destinationChainCtx.getProtocol('TokenBridge');
  // Redeem the VAA on Sepolia to claim the transferred tokens
  // for the specified recipient address
  console.log('📨 Redeeming VAA on Sepolia...');
  const txs = await tokenBridge.redeem(toNative('Sepolia', recipient), vaa);
  // Prepare to collect transaction hashes
  const txHashes: string[] = [];
  // Iterate through the unsigned transactions, sign and send them
  for await (const unsignedTx of txs) {
    const tx = unsignedTx.transaction;
    const sent = await destinationWallet.sendTransaction(tx);
    await sent.wait();
    txHashes.push(sent.hash);
  }
  console.log('✅ Redemption complete. Sepolia txid(s):', txHashes);
}

redeemOnDestination().catch((e) =&gt; {
  console.error('❌ Error in redeemOnDestination:', e);
  process.exit(1);
});
    ```

    This code does the following:

    - Fetches the raw VAA bytes from the `vaa.bin` file
    - Initializes a `wormhole` instance and gets the destination chain context
    - Parses the VAA, gets the signer and Token Bridge protocol for the destination chain
    - Calls `redeem()` and signs the transaction for the recipient to claim the tokens
    - Returns the destination chain transaction ID for the successful redemption

3. Run the script with the following command:
    ```bash
    npx tsx redeem.ts
    ```

4. You will see terminal output similar to the following:

    <div data-termynal="" id="termynal">
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx src/redeem.ts</span>
<span data-ty="">📨 Redeeming VAA on Sepolia...</span>
<span data-ty="">✅ Redemption complete. Sepolia txid(s): [
  '0x1d0bfc789db632c2047f1f53501e1c1900b784a2316d9486b84d05b75b2a9c49'
]</span>
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

Congratulations! You've now completed a manual Token Bridge transfer using the Wormhole TypeScript SDK. Consider the following options to build upon what you've achieved.

# Token Bridge Overview

The Token Bridge is a Wormhole module for bridging wrapped tokens across various blockchain networks. Locking assets on one network and minting corresponding wrapped tokens on another facilitates secure, efficient, and composable multichain token movement.

This overview covers Token Bridge's main features, general processes, and possible next steps to begin building a cross-chain application.

## Key Features

Token Bridge is built to solve interoperability problems in multichain token transfers. Key features include:

- **Interoperability**: Transfer standards-compliant tokens (e.g., ERC-20, SPL) across over 30 [supported chains](/docs/products/reference/supported-networks/#token-bridge){target=\_blank}.
- **Lock-and-mint mechanism**: Mint wrapped tokens backed 1:1 by locked assets on the source chain.
- **Preserved metadata**: Ensure that token properties like name, symbol, and decimals persist across chains.
- **Transfer with payload**: Attach arbitrary data to token transfers, enabling the triggering of specific actions.
- **Decentralized security**: Verified by the [Guardian Network](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank}, ensuring cross-chain consistency and message authenticity.

## How It Works

The Token Bridge provides a reliable foundation for multichain interoperability at scale. The transfer process follows these key steps:

1. **Attestation**: The token’s metadata (e.g., symbol, name, decimals) is registered on the destination chain. This step is only required once per token.
2. **Locking**: On the source chain, the native token is locked in a custody account.
3. **Message emission**: The [Guardian Network](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} verifies and emits a [VAA](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}.
4. **Verification**: The VAA is submitted and verified on the destination chain to confirm authenticity.
5. **Minting**: A wrapped version of the token is minted (or the native token is released) to the recipient on the destination chain.

# Get Started with Messaging

Wormhole's core functionality allows you to send any data packet from one supported chain to another. This guide demonstrates how to publish your first simple, arbitrary data message from an EVM environment source chain using the Wormhole TypeScript SDK's core messaging capabilities. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank} installed
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/){target=\_blank} installed
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/getting-started/){target=\_blank} installed (this example uses version 6)
- A small amount of testnet tokens for gas fees. This example uses [Sepolia ETH](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/){target=\_blank} but can be adapted for any supported network
- A private key for signing blockchain transactions

## Configure Your Messaging Environment

1. Create a directory and initialize a Node.js project:

    ```bash
    mkdir core-message
    cd core-message
    npm init -y
    ```

2. Install TypeScript, tsx, Node.js type definitions, and Ethers.js:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev tsx typescript @types/node ethers
    ```

3. Create a `tsconfig.json` file if you don't have one. You can generate a basic one using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx tsc --init
    ```

    Make sure your `tsconfig.json` includes the following settings:

    ```json 
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            // es2020 or newer
            "target": "es2020",
            // Use esnext if you configured your package.json with type: "module"
            "module": "commonjs",
            "esModuleInterop": true,
            "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
            "strict": true,
            "skipLibCheck": true,
            "resolveJsonModule": true
            }
    }
    ```

4. Install the [TypeScript SDK](/docs/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/){target=\_blank}:

    ```bash
    npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk
    ```

5. Create a new file named `main.ts`:

    ```bash
    touch main.ts
    ```

## Construct and Publish Your Message

1. Open `main.ts` and update the code there as follows:

    ```ts title="main.ts"

    const primaryTxid = primaryTxIdObject.txid;

main().catch((e) =&gt; {
  console.error('Critical error in main function (outer catch):', e);

    console.error('Stack Trace:', e.stack);
  }
  process.exit(1);
});</unsignedtransaction<network,></chain></network></network,>
    ```

    This script initializes the SDK, defines values for the source chain, creates an EVM signer, constructs the message, uses the core protocol to generate, sign, and send the transaction, and returns the VAA identifiers upon successful publication of the message.

2. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx tsx main.ts
    ```

    You will see terminal output similar to the following:

# Get Started with Core Contracts

## Introduction

Wormhole's Core Contracts, deployed on each supported blockchain network, enable the fundamental operations of sending and receiving cross-chain messages.

While the implementation details of the Core Contracts varies by network, the core functionality remains consistent across chains. Each version of the Core Contract facilitates secure and reliable cross-chain communication, ensuring that developers can effectively publish and verify messages.

This guide will walk you through the variations and key methods of the Core Contracts, providing you with the knowledge needed to integrate them into your cross-chain contracts. To learn more about Core Contracts' features and how it works, please refer to the [Core Contracts](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} page in the Learn section.

## Prerequisites

To interact with the Wormhole Core Contract, you'll need the following:

- The [address of the Core Contract](/docs/products/reference/contract-addresses/#core-contracts){target=\_blank} on the chains you're deploying your contract on
- The [Wormhole chain ID](/docs/products/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} of the chains you're deploying your contract on
- The [Wormhole Finality](/docs/products/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} (consistency) levels (required finality) for the chains you're deploying your contract on

## How to Interact with Core Contracts

Before writing your own contracts, it's essential to understand the key functions and events of the Wormhole Core Contracts. The primary functionality revolves around:

- **Sending messages** - submitting messages to the Wormhole network for cross-chain communication
- **Receiving and verifying messages** - validating messages received from other chains via the Wormhole network

While the implementation details of the Core Contracts vary by network, the core functionality remains consistent across chains.

### Sending Messages

To send a message, regardless of the environment or chain, the Core Contract is invoked with a message argument from an [emitter](/docs/products/reference/glossary/#emitter){target=\_blank}. This emitter might be your contract or an existing application such as the [Token Bridge](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank}.

=== "EVM"

    The `IWormhole.sol` interface provides the `publishMessage` function, which can be used to publish a message directly to the Core Contract:

    ```solidity
    function publishMessage(
    uint32 nonce,
    bytes memory payload,
    uint8 consistencyLevel
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `nonce` ++"uint32"++
        
        A free integer field that can be used however you like. Note that changing the `nonce` will result in a different digest.

        ---

        `payload` ++"bytes memory"++
        
        The content of the emitted message. Due to the constraints of individual blockchains, it may be capped to a certain maximum length.

        ---

        `consistencyLevel` ++"uint8"++
        
        A value that defines the required level of finality that must be reached before the Guardians will observe and attest to emitted events.

    ??? interface "Returns"

        `sequence` ++"uint64"++
        
        A unique number that increments for every message for a given emitter (and implicitly chain). This, combined with the emitter address and emitter chain ID, allows the VAA for this message to be queried from the [Wormholescan API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}.
    
    ??? interface "Example"

        ```solidity
        IWormhole wormhole = IWormhole(wormholeAddr);

// Get the fee for publishing a message
uint256 wormholeFee = wormhole.messageFee();

// Check fee and send parameters

// Create the HelloWorldMessage struct
HelloWorldMessage memory parsedMessage = HelloWorldMessage({
    payloadID: uint8(1),
    message: helloWorldMessage
});

// Encode the HelloWorldMessage struct into bytes
bytes memory encodedMessage = encodeMessage(parsedMessage);

// Send the HelloWorld message by calling publishMessage on the
// wormhole core contract and paying the Wormhole protocol fee.
messageSequence = wormhole.publishMessage{value: wormholeFee}(
    0, // batchID
    encodedMessage,
    wormholeFinality()
);
        ```

=== "Solana"

    The `wormhole_anchor_sdk::wormhole` module and the Wormhole program account can be used to pass a message directly to the Core Contract via the `wormhole::post_message` function:

    ```rs
    pub fn post_message<'info>(
        ctx: CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, PostMessage<'info>>,
        batch_id: u32,
        payload: Vec<u8>,
        finality: Finality
    ) -> Result<()>
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `ctx` ++"CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, PostMessage<'info>>"++ 
        
        Provides the necessary context for executing the function, including the accounts and program information required for the Cross-Program Invocation (CPI).

        ??? child "Type `pub struct CpiContext<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T>`"

            ```rs
            pub struct CpiContext<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T>
            where
                T: ToAccountMetas + ToAccountInfos<'info>,
            {
                pub accounts: T,
                pub remaining_accounts: Vec<AccountInfo<'info>>,
                pub program: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub signer_seeds: &'a [&'b [&'c [u8]]],
            }
            ```

            For more information, please refer to the [`wormhole_anchor_sdk` Rust docs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/0.29.0/anchor_lang/context/struct.CpiContext.html){target=\_blank}.

        ??? child "Type `PostMessage<'info>`"

            ```rs
            pub struct PostMessage<'info> {
                pub config: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub message: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub emitter: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub sequence: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub payer: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub fee_collector: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub clock: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub rent: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub system_program: AccountInfo<'info>,
            }
            ```

            For more information, please refer to the [`wormhole_anchor_sdk` Rust docs](https://docs.rs/wormhole-anchor-sdk/latest/wormhole_anchor_sdk/wormhole/instructions/struct.PostMessage.html){target=\_blank}.

        ---

        `batch_id` ++"u32"++
        
        An identifier for the message batch.

        ---

        `payload` ++"Vec<u8>"++
        
        The data being sent in the message. This is a variable-length byte array that contains the actual content or information being transmitted. To learn about the different types of payloads, check out the [VAAs](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas#payload-types){target=\_blank} page.

        ---

        `finality` ++"Finality"++
        
        Specifies the level of finality or confirmation required for the message.
        
        ??? child "Type `Finality`"

            ```rs
            pub enum Finality {
                Confirmed,
                Finalized,
            }
            ```
    
    ??? interface "Returns"

        ++"Result<()>"++
        
        The result of the function’s execution. If the function completes successfully, it returns `Ok(())`, otherwise it returns `Err(E)`, indicating that an error occurred along with the details about the error
    
    ??? interface "Example"

        ```rust
        let fee = ctx.accounts.wormhole_bridge.fee();
// ... Check fee and send parameters

let config = &amp;ctx.accounts.config
let payload: Vec<u8> = HelloWorldMessage::Hello { message }.try_to_vec()?;

// Invoke `wormhole::post_message`.
wormhole::post_message(
    CpiContext::new_with_signer(
        ctx.accounts.wormhole_program.to_account_info(),
        wormhole::PostMessage {
            // ... Set fields
        },
        &amp;[
            // ... Set seeds
        ],
    ),
    config.batch_id,
    payload,
    config.finality.into(),
)?;</u8>
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/solana/programs/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

Once the message is emitted from the Core Contract, the [Guardian Network](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} will observe the message and sign the digest of an Attestation [VAA](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}. On EVM chains, the body of the VAA is hashed twice with keccak256 to produce the signed digest message. On Solana, the [Solana secp256k1 program](https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs#secp256k1-program){target=\_blank} will hash the message passed. In this case, the argument for the message should be a single hash of the body, not the twice-hashed body.

VAAs are [multicast](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/#multicast){target=\_blank} by default. This means there is no default target chain for a given message. The application developer decides on the format of the message and its treatment upon receipt.

### Receiving Messages

The way a message is received and handled depends on the environment.

=== "EVM"

    On EVM chains, the message passed is the raw VAA encoded as binary. The `IWormhole.sol` interface provides the `parseAndVerifyVM` function, which can be used to parse and verify the received message.

    ```solidity
    function parseAndVerifyVM(
    bytes calldata encodedVM
) external view returns (VM memory vm, bool valid, string memory reason);
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `encodedVM` ++"bytes calldata"++
        
        The encoded message as a Verified Action Approval (VAA), which contains all necessary information for verification and processing.

    ??? interface "Returns"

        `vm` ++"VM memory"++
        
        The valid parsed VAA, which will include the original `emitterAddress`, `sequenceNumber`, and `consistencyLevel`, among other fields outlined on the [VAAs](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/) page.

        ??? child "Struct `VM`"

            ```solidity
            struct VM {
                uint8 version;
                uint32 timestamp;
                uint32 nonce;
                uint16 emitterChainId;
                bytes32 emitterAddress;
                uint64 sequence;
                uint8 consistencyLevel;
                bytes payload;
                uint32 guardianSetIndex;
                Signature[] signatures;
                bytes32 hash;
            }
            ```

            For more information, refer to the [`IWormhole.sol` interface](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/IWormhole.sol){target=\_blank}.

        ---
        
        `valid` ++"bool"++
        
        A boolean indicating whether the VAA is valid or not.
        
        ---

        `reason` ++"string"++
        
        If the VAA is not valid, a reason will be provided

    ??? interface "Example"

        ```solidity
        function receiveMessage(bytes memory encodedMessage) public {
    // Call the Wormhole core contract to parse and verify the encodedMessage
    (
        IWormhole.VM memory wormholeMessage,
        bool valid,
        string memory reason
    ) = wormhole().parseAndVerifyVM(encodedMessage);

    // Perform safety checks here

    // Decode the message payload into the HelloWorldMessage struct
    HelloWorldMessage memory parsedMessage = decodeMessage(
        wormholeMessage.payload
    );

    // Your custom application logic here
}
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/evm/src/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

=== "Solana"

    On Solana, the VAA is first posted and verified by the Core Contract, after which it can be read by the receiving contract and action taken.

    Retrieve the raw message data:

    ```rs
    let posted_message = &ctx.accounts.posted;
    posted_message.data()
    ```

    ??? interface "Example"

        ```rust
        pub fn receive_message(ctx: Context<receivemessage>, vaa_hash: [u8; 32]) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    let posted_message = &amp;ctx.accounts.posted

    if let HelloWorldMessage::Hello { message } = posted_message.data() {
        // Check message
        // Your custom application logic here
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err(HelloWorldError::InvalidMessage.into())
    }
}
</receivemessage>
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/solana/programs/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

#### Validating the Emitter

When processing cross-chain messages, it's critical to ensure that the message originates from a trusted sender (emitter). This can be done by verifying the emitter address and chain ID in the parsed VAA.

Typically, contracts should provide a method to register trusted emitters and check incoming messages against this list before processing them. For example, the following check ensures that the emitter is registered and authorized:

```solidity
require(isRegisteredSender(emitterChainId, emitterAddress), "Invalid emitter");
```

This check can be applied after the VAA is parsed, ensuring only authorized senders can interact with the receiving contract. Trusted emitters can be registered using a method like `setRegisteredSender` during contract deployment or initialization.

```typescript
const tx = await receiverContract.setRegisteredSender(
  sourceChain.chainId,
  ethers.zeroPadValue(senderAddress as BytesLike, 32)
);

await tx.wait();
```

#### Additional Checks

In addition to environment-specific checks that should be performed, a contract should take care to check other [fields in the body](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}, including:

- **Sequence** - is this the expected sequence number? How should out-of-order deliveries be handled?
- **Consistency level** - for the chain this message came from, is the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/products/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} level enough to guarantee the transaction won't be reverted after taking some action?

The VAA digest is separate from the VAA body but is also relevant. It can be used for replay protection by checking if the digest has already been seen. Since the payload itself is application-specific, there may be other elements to check to ensure safety.

# Wormhole Relayer

## Introduction

The Wormhole-deployed relayers provide a mechanism for contracts on one blockchain to send messages to contracts on another without requiring off-chain infrastructure. Through the Wormhole relayer module, developers can use an untrusted delivery provider to transport VAAs, saving the need to build and maintain custom relaying solutions. The option to [run a custom relayer](/docs/protocol/infrastructure-guides/run-relayer/) is available for more complex needs.

This section covers the components and interfaces involved in using the Wormhole relayer module, such as message sending and receiving, delivery guarantees, and considerations for building reliable and efficient cross-chain applications. Additionally, you'll find details on how to handle specific implementation scenarios and track message delivery progress using the Wormhole CLI tool.

## Get Started with the Wormhole Relayer

Before getting started, it's important to note that the Wormhole-deployed relayer configuration is currently **limited to EVM environments**. The complete list of EVM environment blockchains is on the [Supported Networks](/docs/products/reference/supported-networks/) page.

To interact with the Wormhole relayer, you'll need to create contracts on the source and target chains to handle the sending and receiving of messages. No off-chain logic needs to be implemented to take advantage of Wormhole-powered relaying.

### Wormhole Relayer Interfaces

There are three relevant interfaces to discuss when utilizing the Wormhole relayer module:

- [**`IWormholeRelayer`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IWormholeRelayer.sol){target=\_blank} - the primary interface by which you send and receive messages. It allows you to request the sending of messages and VAAs
- [**`IWormholeReceiver`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IWormholeReceiver.sol){target=\_blank} - this is the interface you are responsible for implementing. It allows the selected delivery provider to deliver messages/VAAs to your contract
- [**`IDeliveryProvider`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IDeliveryProvider.sol){target=\_blank} - this interface represents the delivery pricing information for a given relayer network. Each delivery provider implements this on every blockchain they support delivering from

## Interact with the Wormhole Relayer

To start interacting with the Wormhole relayer in your contracts, you'll need to import the `IWormholeRelayer` interface and set up a reference using the contract address to the Wormhole-deployed relayer on the supported network of your choice.

To easily integrate with the Wormhole relayer interface, you can use the [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank}.

To retrieve the contract address of the Wormhole relayer, refer to the Wormhole relayer section on the [Contract Addresses](/docs/products/reference/contract-addresses/#wormhole-relayer) reference page.

Your initial set up should resemble the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "wormhole-solidity-sdk/interfaces/IWormholeRelayer.sol";

contract Example {
    IWormholeRelayer public wormholeRelayer;

    constructor(address _wormholeRelayer) {
        wormholeRelayer = IWormholeRelayer(_wormholeRelayer);
    }
}
```

The code provided sets up the basic structure for your contract to interact with the Wormhole relayer using the address supplied to the constructor. By leveraging methods from the `IWormholeRelayer` interface, you can implement message sending and receiving functionalities. The following sections will detail the specific methods you need to use for these tasks.

### Send a Message

To send a message to a contract on another EVM chain, you can call the `sendPayloadToEvm` method provided by the `IWormholeRelayer` interface.

```solidity
function sendPayloadToEvm(
    // Chain ID in Wormhole format
    uint16 targetChain,     
    // Contract Address on target chain we're sending a message to
    address targetAddress,  
    // The payload, encoded as bytes
    bytes memory payload,   
    // How much value to attach to the delivery transaction 
    uint256 receiverValue,  
    // The gas limit to set on the delivery transaction
    uint256 gasLimit        
) external payable returns (
    // Unique, incrementing ID, used to identify a message
    uint64 sequence
);
```

!!! tip
    To reduce transaction confirmation time, you can lower the consistency level using the [`sendToEvm`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/v{{repositories.wormhole.version}}/sdk/js/src/relayer/relayer/send.ts#L33){target=\_blank} method.

The `sendPayloadToEvm` method is marked `payable` to receive fee payment for the transaction. The value to attach to the invocation is determined by calling the `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice`, which provides an estimate of the cost of gas on the target chain.

```solidity
function quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
    // Chain ID in Wormhole format
    uint16 targetChain,
    // How much value to attach to delivery transaction 
    uint256 receiverValue,
    // The gas limit to attach to the delivery transaction
    uint256 gasLimit
) external view returns (
    // How much value to attach to the send call
    uint256 nativePriceQuote, 
    uint256 targetChainRefundPerGasUnused
);
```

This method should be called before sending a message, and the value returned for `nativePriceQuote` should be attached to the call to send the payload to cover the transaction's cost on the target chain.

In total, sending a message across EVM chains can be as simple as getting a fee quote and sending the message as follows:

```solidity
// Get a quote for the cost of gas for delivery
(cost, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
    targetChain,
    valueToSend,
    GAS_LIMIT
);

// Send the message
wormholeRelayer.sendPayloadToEvm{value: cost}(
    targetChain,
    targetAddress,
    abi.encode(payload),
    valueToSend, 
    GAS_LIMIT
);
```

### Receive a Message

To receive a message using a Wormhole relayer, the target contract must implement the [`IWormholeReceiver`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IWormholeReceiver.sol){target=\_blank} interface, as shown in the [previous section](#interact-with-the-wormhole-relayer).

```solidity
function receiveWormholeMessages(
    bytes memory payload,           // Message passed by source contract 
    bytes[] memory additionalVaas,  // Any additional VAAs that are needed (Note: these are unverified) 
    bytes32 sourceAddress,          // The address of the source contract
    uint16 sourceChain,             // The Wormhole chain ID
    bytes32 deliveryHash            // A hash of contents, useful for replay protection
) external payable;
```

The logic inside the function body may be whatever business logic is required to take action on the specific payload.

## Delivery Guarantees

The Wormhole relayer protocol is intended to create a service interface whereby mutually distrustful integrators and delivery providers can work together to provide a seamless dApp experience. You don't trust the delivery providers with your data, and the delivery providers don't trust your smart contract. The primary agreement between integrators and delivery providers is that when a delivery is requested, the provider will attempt to deliver the VAA within the provider's stated delivery timeframe.

This creates a marketplace whereby providers can set different price levels and service guarantees. Delivery providers effectively accept the slippage risk premium of delivering your VAAs in exchange for a set fee rate. Thus, the providers agree to deliver your messages even if they do so at a loss.

Delivery providers should set their prices such that they turn a profit on average but not necessarily on every single transfer. Thus, some providers may choose to set higher rates for tighter guarantees or lower rates for less stringent guarantees.

## Delivery Statuses

All deliveries result in one of the following four outcomes before the delivery provider's delivery timeframe. When they occur, these outcomes are emitted as EVM events from the Wormhole relayer contract. The four possible outcomes are:

- (0) Delivery Success
- (1) Receiver Failure
- (2) Forward Request Success
- (3) Forward Request Failure

A receiver failure is a scenario in which the selected provider attempted the delivery but it could not be completely successfully. The three possible causes for a delivery failure are:

- The target contract does not implement the `IWormholeReceiver` interface
- The target contract threw an exception or reverted during the execution of `receiveWormholeMessages`
- The target contract exceeded the specified `gasLimit` while executing `receiveWormholeMessages`

All three of these scenarios can be avoided with correct design by the integrator, and thus, it is up to the integrator to resolve them. Any other scenario that causes a delivery to not be performed should be considered an outage by some component of the system, including potentially the blockchains themselves.

`Forward Request Success` and `Forward Failure` represent when the delivery succeeded and the user requested a forward during the delivery. If the user has enough funds left over as a refund to complete the forward, the forward will be executed, and the status will be `Forward Request Success`. Otherwise, it will be `Forward Request Failure`.

## Other Considerations

Some implementation details should be considered during development to ensure safety and a pleasant UX. Ensure that your engineering efforts have appropriately considered each of the following areas:

- Receiving a message from a relayer
- Checking for expected emitter
- Calling `parseAndVerify` on any additional VAAs
- Replay protection
- Message ordering (no guarantees on order of messages delivered)
- Forwarding and call chaining
- Refunding overpayment of `gasLimit`
- Refunding overpayment of value sent

## Track the Progress of Messages with the Wormhole CLI

While no off-chain programs are required, a developer may want to track the progress of messages in flight. To track the progress of messages in flight, use the [Wormhole CLI](/docs/tools/cli/get-started/){target=\_blank} tool's `status` subcommand. As an example, you can use the following commands to track the status of a transfer by providing the environment, origin network, and transaction hash to the `worm status` command:

=== "Mainnet"

    ```bash
    worm status mainnet ethereum INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH
    ```

=== "Testnet"

    ```bash
    worm status testnet ethereum INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH
    ```

See the [Wormhole CLI tool docs](/docs/tools/cli/get-started/){target=\_blank} for installation and usage.

# Messaging Overview 

Wormhole Messaging is the core protocol of the Wormhole ecosystem—a generic, multichain message-passing layer that enables secure, fast communication between blockchains. It solves the critical problem of blockchain isolation by allowing data and assets to move freely across networks, empowering developers to build true multichain applications.

## Key Features

- **Multichain messaging**: Send arbitrary data between blockchains, enabling xDapps, governance actions, or coordination across ecosystems.
- **Decentralized validation**: A network of independent [Guardians](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} observes and signs multichain messages, producing [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} that ensure integrity.
- **Composable architecture**: Works with smart contracts, token bridges, or decentralized applications, providing a flexible foundation for multichain use cases.

## How It Works

The messaging flow consists of several core components:

1. **Source chain (emitter contract)**: A contract emits a message by calling the Wormhole [Core Contract](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} on the source chain.
2. **Guardian Network**: [Guardians](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} observe the message, validate it, and generate a signed [VAA](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}.
3. **Relayers**: Off-chain or on-chain [relayers](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank} transport the VAA to the destination chain.
4. **Target chain (recipient contract)**: The [Core Contract](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} on the destination chain verifies the VAA and triggers the specified application logic.

![Wormhole architecture detailed diagram: source to target chain communication.](/docs/images/protocol/architecture/architecture-1.webp)

description: Explore a comprehensive glossary of technical terms and key concepts used in the Wormhole network, covering Chain ID, Guardian, VAA, and more.
categories: Basics
---

# Glossary

This glossary is an index of technical term definitions for words commonly used in Wormhole documentation.

## Chain ID

Wormhole assigns a unique `u16` integer chain ID to each supported blockchain. These chain IDs are specific to Wormhole and may differ from those used by blockchains to identify their networks.

You can find each chain ID documented on the [Wormhole Chain IDs](/docs/products/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} page.

## Consistency Level

The level of finality (consistency) a transaction should meet before being signed by a Guardian. See the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/products/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} reference page for details.

## Delivery Provider

A Delivery Provider monitors for Wormhole Relayer delivery requests and delivers those requests to the intended target chain as instructed.

## Emitter

The emitter contract makes the call to the Wormhole Core Contract. The published message includes the emitter contract address and, a sequence number for the message is tracked to provide a unique ID.

## Finality

The finality of a transaction depends on its blockchain properties. Once a transaction is considered final, you can assume the resulting state changes it caused won't be reverted.

## Guardian

A [Guardian](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} is one of the 19 parties running validators in the Guardian Network contributing to the VAA multisig.

## Guardian Network

Validators in their own P2P network who serve as Wormhole's oracle by observing activity on-chain and generating signed messages attesting to that activity.

## Guardian Set

The Guardian Set is a set of guardians responsible for validating a message emitted from the core contracts. Occasionally, the members of the set will change through a governance action.

## Heartbeat

Each Guardian will issue a `heartbeat` on a 15-second interval to signal that it is still running and convey details about its identity, uptime, version, and the status of the connected nodes.

You can view the heartbeats on the [Wormhole dashboard](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}.

## Observation

An Observation is a data structure describing a message emitted by the Core Contract and noticed by the Guardian node.

## Relayer

A relayer is any process that delivers VAAs to a destination.

## Sequence

A nonce, strictly increasing, which is tracked by the Wormhole Core Contract and unique to the emitter chain and address.

## Spy

A Spy is a daemon that eavesdrops on the messages passed between Guardians, typically to track VAAs as they get signed.

## VAA

[Verifiable Action Approvals](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} (VAAs) are the base data structure in the Wormhole ecosystem. They contain emitted messages along with information such as what contract emitted the message.

## Validator

A daemon configured to monitor a blockchain node and observe messages emitted by the Wormhole contracts.

# Architecture

## Overview

Wormhole has several noteworthy components. Before discussing each component in depth, this page will provide an overview of how the major pieces fit together.

![Wormhole architecture detailed diagram: source to target chain communication.](/docs/images/protocol/architecture/architecture-1.webp)

The preceding diagram outlines the end-to-end flow of multichain communication through Wormhole's architecture, which is described as follows:

1. **Source chain** - a source contract emits a message by interacting with the [Wormhole Core Contract](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} on the source chain, which publishes the message in the blockchain's transaction logs
2. **Guardian Network** - [Guardians](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} validate these messages and sign them to produce [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}
3. **Relayers** - off-chain relayers or applications fetch the VAA and relay it to the target chain
4. **Target chain** - on the target chain, the message is consumed by the appropriate contract. This contract interacts with the Wormhole Core Contract to verify the VAA and execute the intended multichain operation. 

    The flow from the relayer to the target chain involves an entry point contract, which could vary based on the use case:

    - In some applications, the target contract acts as the entry point and performs verification via the Core Contract
    - In products like the Token Bridge, the Token Bridge contract itself interacts with the Core Contract

## On-Chain Components

- **Emitter** - a contract that calls the publish message method on the Core Contract. To identify the message, the Core Contract will write an event to the transaction logs with details about the emitter and sequence number. This may be your cross-chain dApp or an existing ecosystem protocol
- **[Wormhole Core Contract](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank}** - primary contract, this is the contract which the Guardians observe and which fundamentally allows for multichain communication
- **Transaction logs** - blockchain-specific logs that allow the Guardians to observe messages emitted by the Core Contract

## Off-Chain Components

- **Guardian Network** - validators that exist in their own P2P network. Guardians observe and validate the messages emitted by the Core Contract on each supported chain to produce VAAs (signed messages)
- **[Guardian](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank}** - one of 19 validators in the Guardian Network that contributes to the VAA multisig
- **[Spy](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/spy/){target=\_blank}** - a daemon that subscribes to messages published within the Guardian Network. A Spy can observe and forward network traffic, which helps scale up VAA distribution
- **[API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}** - a REST server to retrieve details for a VAA or the Guardian Network
- **[VAAs](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}** - Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs) are the signed attestation of an observed message from the Wormhole Core Contract
- **[Relayer](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank}** - any off-chain process that relays a VAA to the target chain
    - **Wormhole relayers** - a decentralized relayer network that delivers messages that are requested on-chain via the Wormhole relayer contract
    - **Custom relayers** - relayers that only handle VAAs for a specific protocol or multichain application. They can execute custom logic off-chain, reducing gas costs and increasing multichain compatibility. Currently, multichain application developers are responsible for developing and hosting custom relayers

# The Wormhole Ecosystem

[Wormhole](/docs/protocol/introduction/){target=\_blank} is a cross-chain messaging protocol connecting decentralized applications across multiple blockchains. It offers a suite of interoperability tools, each addressing different multichain challenges, and allows developers to mix and match these products as needed.

Whether you’re looking for a simple UI-based bridging experience, a native token transfer flow without wrapped assets, real-time cross-chain data queries, or an advanced settlement layer for complex asset movements, Wormhole has a product designed for that purpose. Every solution integrates with Wormhole’s core messaging network, ensuring each module can operate independently or in combination with others.

This page will guide you through the structural layout of these tools—how they fit together, can be used independently, and can be layered to build robust, multichain applications.

## Ecosystem Overview

The diagram shows a high-level view of Wormhole’s modular stack, illustrating how different tools are grouped into four layers:

- **Application and user-facing products**: The top layer includes user-centric solutions such as [Connect](/docs/products/connect/overview/){target=\_blank} (a simple bridging interface) and the [NTT Launchpad](https://ntt.wormhole.com/){target=\_blank} (for streamlined native asset deployments).
- **Asset and data transfer layer**: Below it sits the core bridging and data solutions—[NTT](/docs/products/native-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank}, [Token Bridge](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank}, [Queries](/docs/products/queries/overview/){target=\_blank}, [Settlement](/docs/products/settlement/overview/){target=\_blank}, and [MultiGov](/docs/products/multigov/overview/){target=\_blank}—that handle the movement of tokens, real-time data fetching, advanced cross-chain settlements, and cross-chain governance.
- **Integration layer**: The [TypeScript SDK](/docs/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/){target=\_blank}, [Solidity SDK](/docs/tools/solidity-sdk/get-started/){target=\_blank}, and [WormholeScan API](https://wormholescan.io/#/){target=\_blank} provide developer-friendly libraries and APIs to integrate cross-chain capabilities into applications.
- **Foundation layer**: At the base, the [Wormhole messaging](/docs/products/messaging/overview/){target=\_blank} system and the [core contracts](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} secure the entire network, providing essential verification and cross-chain message delivery.

## Bringing It All Together: Interoperability in Action

Wormhole’s modularity makes it easy to adopt just the pieces you need. If you want to quickly add bridging to a dApp, use Connect at the top layer while relying on the Foundation Layer behind the scenes. Or if your app needs to send raw messages between chains, integrate the Messaging layer directly via the Integration Layer (TypeScript or Solidity SDK). You can even layer on additional features—like real-time data calls from Queries or more flexible bridging flows with Native Token Transfers.

Ultimately, these components aren’t siloed but designed to be combined. You could, for instance, fetch a balance from one chain using Queries and then perform an on-chain swap on another chain using Settlement. Regardless of your approach, each Wormhole product is powered by the same Guardian-secured messaging backbone, ensuring all cross-chain interactions remain reliable and secure.

# Core Contracts

## Introduction

The Wormhole Core Contract is deployed across each supported blockchain network. This contract is a fundamental component of the Wormhole interoperability protocol and acts as the foundational layer enabling secure and efficient multichain messaging. All multichain applications either interact directly with the Core Contract or with another contract that does.

This page summarizes the key functions of the Core Contract and outlines how the Core Contract works.

## Key Functions 

Key functions of the Wormhole Core Contract include the following:

- **Multichain messaging** - standardizes and secures the format of messages to facilitate consistent communication for message transfer between Wormhole-connected blockchain networks, allowing developers to leverage the unique features of each network
- **Verification and validation** - verifies and validates all VAAs received on the target chain by confirming the Guardian signature to ensure the message is legitimate and has not been manipulated or altered
- **Guardian Network coordination** - coordinates with Wormhole's Guardian Network to facilitate secure, trustless communication across chains and ensure that only validated interactions are processed to enhance the protocol's overall security and reliability
- **Event emission for monitoring**  - emits events for every multichain message processed, allowing for network activity monitoring like tracking message statuses, debugging, and applications that can react to multichain events in real time

## How the Core Contract Works

The Wormhole Core Contract is central in facilitating secure and efficient multichain transactions. It enables communication between different blockchain networks by packaging transaction data into standardized messages, verifying their authenticity, and ensuring they are executed correctly on the destination chain.

The following describes the role of the Wormhole Core Contract in message transfers:

1. **Message submission** - when a user initiates a multichain transaction, the Wormhole Core Contract on the source chain packages the transaction data into a standardized message payload and submits it to the Guardian Network for verification
2. **Guardian verification** - the Guardians independently observe and sign the message. Once enough Guardians have signed the message, the collection of signatures is combined with the message and metadata to produce a VAA
3. **Message reception and execution** - on the target chain, the Wormhole Core Contract receives the verified message, checks the Guardians' signatures, and executes the corresponding actions like minting tokens, updating states, or calling specific smart contract functions

For a closer look at how messages flow between chains and all of the components involved, you can refer to the [Architecture Overview](/docs/protocol/architecture/) page.

### Message Submission

You can send multichain messages by calling a function against the source chain Core Contract, which then publishes the message. Message publishing strategies can differ by chain; however, generally, the Core Contract posts the following items to the blockchain logs:

- `emitterAddress` - the contract which made the call to publish the message
- `sequenceNumber` - a unique number that increments for every message for a given emitter (and implicitly chain)
- `consistencyLevel`- the level of finality to reach before the Guardians will observe and attest the emitted event. This is a defense against reorgs and rollbacks since a transaction, once considered "final,"  is guaranteed not to have the state changes it caused rolled back. Since different chains use different consensus mechanisms, each one has different finality assumptions, so this value is treated differently on a chain-by-chain basis. See the options for finality for each chain in the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/products/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} reference page

There are no fees to publish a message except when publishing on Solana, but this is subject to change in the future.

### Message Reception

When you receive a multichain message on the target chain Core Contract, you generally must parse and verify the [components of a VAA](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas#vaa-format){target=\_blank}. Receiving and verifying a VAA ensures that the Guardian Network properly attests to the message and maintains the integrity and authenticity of the data transmitted between chains.

## Multicast

Multicast refers to simultaneously broadcasting a single message or transaction across different blockchains with no destination address or chain for the sending and receiving functions. VAAs attest that "this contract on this chain said this thing." Therefore, VAAs are multicast by default and will be verified as authentic on any chain where they are used.

This multicast-by-default model makes it easy to synchronize state across the entire ecosystem. A blockchain can make its data available to every chain in a single action with low latency, which reduces the complexity of the n^2 problems encountered by routing data to many blockchains.

This doesn't mean an application _cannot_ specify a destination address or chain. For example, the [Token Bridge](/docs/products/token-bridge/overview/){target=\_blank} and [Wormhole relayer](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank} contracts require that some destination details be passed and verified on the destination chain.

Because the VAA creation is separate from relaying, the multicast model does not incur an additional cost when a single chain is targeted. If the data isn't needed on a certain blockchain, don't relay it there, and it won't cost anything.

description: Explore Wormhole's Guardian Network, a decentralized system for secure, scalable cross-chain communication across various blockchain ecosystems.
categories: Basics

## Guardian

Wormhole relies on a set of 19 distributed nodes that monitor the state on several blockchains. In Wormhole, these nodes are referred to as Guardians. The current Guardian set can be seen in the [Dashboard](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}.

Guardians fulfill their role in the messaging protocol as follows: 

1. Each Guardian observes messages and signs the corresponding payloads in isolation from the other Guardians
2. Guardians combine their independent signatures to form a multisig
3. This multisig represents proof that a majority of the Wormhole network has observed and agreed upon a state

Wormhole refers to these multisigs as [Verifiable Action Approvals](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} (VAAs).

## Guardian Network

The Guardian Network functions as Wormhole's decentralized oracle, ensuring secure, cross-chain interoperability. Learning about this critical element of the Wormhole ecosystem will help you better understand the protocol. 

The Guardian Network is designed to help Wormhole deliver on five key principles:

- **Decentralization** - control of the network is distributed across many parties
- **Modularity** - independent components (e.g., oracle, relayer, applications) ensure flexibility and upgradeability
- **Chain agnosticism** - supports EVM, Solana, and other blockchains without relying on a single network
- **Scalability** - can handle large transaction volumes and high-value transfers
- **Upgradeable** - can change the implementation of its existing modules without breaking integrators to adapt to changes in decentralized computing

The following sections explore each principle in detail. 

### Decentralization

Decentralization remains the core concern for interoperability protocols. Earlier solutions were fully centralized, and even newer models often rely on a single entity or just one or two actors, creating low thresholds for collusion or failure.

Two common approaches to decentralization have notable limitations:

- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** - while PoS is often seen as a go-to model for decentralization, it's not well-suited for a network that verifies many blockchains and doesn't run its own smart contracts. Its security in this context is unproven, and it introduces complexities that make other design goals harder to achieve
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** - ZKPs offer a trustless and decentralized approach, but the technology is still early-stage. On-chain verification is often too computationally expensive—especially on less capable chains—so a multisig-based fallback is still required for practical deployment

In the current De-Fi landscape, most major blockchains are secured by a small group of validator companies. Only a limited number of companies worldwide have the expertise and capital to run high-performance validators.

If a protocol could unite many of these top validator companies into a purpose-built consensus mechanism designed for interoperability, it would likely offer better performance and security than a token-incentivized network. The key question is: how many of them could Wormhole realistically involve?

To answer that, consider these key constraints and design decisions:

- **Threshold signatures allow flexibility, but** - with threshold signatures, in theory, any number of validators could participate. However, threshold signatures are not yet widely supported across blockchains. Verifying them is expensive and complex, especially in a chain-agnostic system
- **t-Schnorr multisig is more practical** - Wormhole uses [t-Schnorr multisig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature){target=\_blank}, which is broadly supported and relatively inexpensive to verify. However, verification costs scale linearly with the number of signers, so the size of the validator set needs to be carefully chosen
- **19 validators is the optimal tradeoff** - a set of 19 participants presents a practical compromise between decentralization and efficiency. With a two-thirds consensus threshold, only 13 signatures must be verified on-chain—keeping gas costs reasonable while ensuring strong security
- **Security through reputation, not tokens** - Wormhole relies on a network of established validator companies instead of token-based incentives. These 19 Guardians are among the most trusted operators in the industry—real entities with a track record, not anonymous participants

This forms the foundation for a purpose-built Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus model, where each Guardian has an equal stake. As threshold signatures gain broader support, the set can expand. Once ZKPs become widely viable, the network can evolve into a fully trustless system.

### Modularity

Wormhole is designed with simple components that are very good at a single function. Separating security and consensus (Guardians) from message delivery ([relayers](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank}) allows for the flexibility to change or upgrade one component without disrupting the others.

### Chain Agnosticism

Today, Wormhole supports a broader range of ecosystems than any other interoperability protocol because it uses simple tech (t-schnorr signatures), an adaptable, heterogeneous relayer model, and a robust validator network. Wormhole can expand to new ecosystems as quickly as a [Core Contract](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} can be developed for the smart contract runtime.

### Scalability

Wormhole scales well, as demonstrated by its ability to handle substantial total value locked (TVL) and transaction volume even during tumultuous events.

Every Guardian must run a full node for every blockchain in the ecosystem. This requirement can be computationally heavy to set up; however, once all the full nodes are running, the Guardian Network's actual computation needs become lightweight. 

Performance is generally limited by the speed of the underlying blockchains, not the Guardian Network itself.

### Upgradeable

Wormhole is designed to adapt and evolve in the following ways:

- **Guardian Set expansion** – future updates may introduce threshold signatures to allow for more Guardians in the set
- **ZKP integration** - as Zero-Knowledge Proofs become more widely supported, the network can transition to a fully trustless model

These principles combine to create a clear pathway towards a fully trustless interoperability layer that spans decentralized computing.

# Relayers

This page provides a comprehensive guide to relayers within the Wormhole network, describing their role, types, and benefits in facilitating cross-chain processes.

Relayers in the Wormhole context are processes that deliver [Verified Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} to their destination, playing a crucial role in Wormhole's security model. They can't compromise security, only availability, and act as delivery mechanisms for VAAs without the capacity to tamper with the outcome.

There are three primary types of relayers discussed:

- **Client-side relaying** - a cost-efficient, no-backend-infrastructure approach relying on user-facing front ends. It provides a simple solution, although it can complicate the user experience due to the manual steps involved

- **Custom relayers** - backend components that handle parts of the cross-chain process, offering a smoother user experience and allowing off-chain calculations to reduce gas costs. These relayers could operate through direct listening to the Guardian Network (Spy relaying)

- **Wormhole-deployed relayers** - a decentralized relayer network that can deliver arbitrary VAAs, reducing the developer's need to develop, host, or maintain relayers. However, they require all calculations to be done on-chain and might be less gas-efficient

## Fundamentals

This section highlights the crucial principles underpinning the operation and handling of relayers within the Wormhole network.

Relayers are fundamentally trustless entities within the network, meaning while they don't require your trust to operate, you also shouldn't trust them implicitly. Relayers function as delivery mechanisms, transporting VAAs from their source to their destination.

Key characteristics of VAAs include:

- Public emission from the Guardian Network

- Authentication through signatures from the Guardian Network

- Verifiability by any entity or any Wormhole Core Contract

These characteristics mean anyone can pick up a VAA and deliver it anywhere, but no one can alter the VAA content without invalidating the signatures. 

Keep in mind the following security considerations around relayers:

- **Trusting information** - it is crucial not to trust information outside your contract or a VAA. Relying on information from a relayer could expose you to input attacks

- **Gas optimization** - using relayers to perform trustless off-chain computation to pass into the destination contract can optimize gas costs but also risk creating attack vectors if not used correctly

- **Deterministic by design** - the design of a relayer should ensure a single, deterministic way to process messages in your protocol. Relayers should have a "correct" implementation, mirroring "crank turner" processes used elsewhere in blockchain

## Client-Side Relaying

Client-side relaying relies on user-facing front ends, such as a webpage or a wallet, to complete the cross-chain process.

### Key Features

- **Cost-efficiency** - users only pay the transaction fee for the second transaction, eliminating any additional costs

- **No backend infrastructure** - the process is wholly client-based, eliminating the need for a backend relaying infrastructure

### Implementation

Users themselves carry out the three steps of the cross-chain process:

1. Perform an action on chain A

2. Retrieve the resulting VAA from the Guardian Network

3. Perform an action on chain B using the VAA

### Considerations

Though simple, this type of relaying is generally not recommended if your aim is a highly polished user experience. It can, however, be useful for getting a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) up and running.

- Users must sign all required transactions with their own wallet

- Users must have funds to pay the transaction fees on every chain involved

- The user experience may be cumbersome due to the manual steps involved

## Custom Relayers

Custom relayers are purpose-built components within the Wormhole protocol, designed to relay messages for specific applications. They can perform off-chain computations and can be customized to suit a variety of use cases.

The main method of setting up a custom relayer is by listening directly to the Guardian Network via a [Spy](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/spy/).

### Key Features

- **Optimization** - capable of performing trustless off-chain computations which can optimize gas costs

- **Customizability** - allows for specific strategies like batching, conditional delivery, multi-chain deliveries, and more

- **Incentive structure** - developers have the freedom to design an incentive structure suitable for their application

- **Enhanced UX** - the ability to retrieve a VAA from the Guardian Network and perform an action on the target chain using the VAA on behalf of the user can simplify the user experience

### Implementation

A plugin relayer to make the development of custom relayers easier is available in the [main Wormhole repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/relayer){target=\_blank}. This plugin sets up the basic infrastructure for relaying, allowing developers to focus on implementing the specific logic for their application.

### Considerations

Remember, despite their name, custom relayers still need to be considered trustless. VAAs are public and can be submitted by anyone, so developers shouldn't rely on off-chain relayers to perform any computation considered "trusted."

- Development work and hosting of relayers are required

- The fee-modeling can become complex, as relayers are responsible for paying target chain fees

- Relayers are responsible for availability, and adding dependencies for the cross-chain application

## Wormhole Relayers

Wormhole relayers are a component of a decentralized network in the Wormhole protocol. They facilitate the delivery of VAAs to recipient contracts compatible with the standard relayer API.

### Key Features

- **Lower operational costs** - no need to develop, host, or maintain individual relayers

- **Simplified integration** - because there is no need to run a relayer, integration is as simple as calling a function and implementing an interface

### Implementation

The Wormhole relayer integration involves two key steps:

- **Delivery request** - request delivery from the ecosystem Wormhole relayer contract

- **Relay reception** - implement a [`receiveWormholeMessages`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/bacbe82e6ae3f7f5ec7cdcd7d480f1e528471bbb/src/interfaces/IWormholeReceiver.sol#L44-L50){target=\_blank} function within their contracts. This function is invoked upon successful relay of the VAA

### Considerations

Developers should note that the choice of relayers depends on their project's specific requirements and constraints. Wormhole relayers offer simplicity and convenience but limit customization and optimization opportunities compared to custom relayers.

- All computations are performed on-chain

- Potentially less gas-efficient compared to custom relayers

- Optimization features like conditional delivery, batching, and off-chain calculations might be restricted

- Support may not be available for all chains

# Spy

In Wormhole's ecosystem, the _Spy_ is a daemon, a continuously running background process that monitors messages within the Guardian Network. Unlike Guardians, a Spy doesn't perform validation; instead, it serves as an interface for observing the network's message traffic, enabling applications and users to access live data transmitted over Wormhole.

The primary purpose of a Spy is to subscribe to the gossiped messages across the Guardian Network, tracking key message types that allow integrators and applications to monitor real-time network activity without directly engaging in consensus operations.

This page provides a comprehensive guide to where the Spy fits within the Wormhole network, describing the key features and role in facilitating multichain processes.

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring of Wormhole messages** - the Spy allows users to observe Wormhole messages as they are published across supported chains in near real-time
- **Filterable and observable message streams** - users can filter message streams by chain, emitter, and other criteria, making it easier to track specific contracts or categories of interest
- **Integration-friendly event streaming** - the Spy exposes gRPC and WebSocket interfaces, making it easy to integrate message observation into custom tooling, dashboards, or indexing services
- **Support for multiple message protocols** - it can observe messages from different Wormhole messaging protocols (Token Bridge, CCTP, NTT, etc.), providing broad coverage of cross-chain activity
- **Lightweight and infrastructure-ready** - the Spy is designed to run as part of indexing or backend services, not requiring validator-level infrastructure

## Integrator Use Case

The Spy provides a valuable mechanism for integrators to observe real-time network activity in the Guardian Network without directly engaging in validation or consensus. By running a Spy, integrators can track multichain events and message flows — such as VAAs, observations, and Guardian heartbeats — to monitor network activity essential to their applications.

This monitoring capability is especially beneficial for applications that need immediate insights into multichain data events. Integrators can run a Spy to ensure their applications are promptly informed of message approvals, observations, or Guardian liveness signals, supporting timely and responsive app behavior without additional overhead on network resources.

## Observable Message Categories

A Spy can access the following categories of messages shared over the gossip protocol:

- [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} - packets of multichain data

    - The Spy can detect whether a VAA has been approved by the Guardian Network, making it a valuable tool for applications needing real-time multichain verification

- [Observations](/docs/products/reference/glossary/#observation){target=\_blank} - emitted by Wormhole's core contracts, observations are picked up by the Guardians and relayed across the network

    - A Spy allow users to monitor these messages, adding transparency and insight into blockchain events

- [Guardian heartbeats](/docs/products/reference/glossary/#heartbeat){target=\_blank} - heartbeat messages represent Guardian node status 

    - By monitoring heartbeats, a Spy can signal the liveness and connectivity of Guardians in the network

# Verified Action Approvals

Verified Action Approvals (VAAs) are Wormhole's core messaging primitive. They are packets of cross-chain data emitted whenever a cross-chain application contract interacts with the Core Contract.

[Guardians](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} validate messages emitted by contracts before sending them to the target chain. Once a majority of Guardians agree the message is valid, they sign a keccak256 hash of the message body. 

The message is wrapped up in a structure called a VAA, which combines the message with the Guardian signatures to form a proof. 

VAAs are uniquely indexed by the (`emitter_chain`, `emitter_address`, `sequence`) tuple. To obtain a VAA, one can query the [Wormholescan API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank} with this information.

The `sequence` field depends on the final ordering of blocks on the emitter chain. When a lower consistency level is chosen (i.e., not waiting for finality), there is a chance that chain reorganizations could lead to multiple, different VAAs appearing for what looks like the “same” message on the user side. 
    
The tuple (`emitter_chain`, `emitter_address`, `sequence`) can only be considered unique if the chain does not undergo a reorg and the block containing the message has effectively reached finality. However, there is always a small chance of an extended reorg that could invalidate or alter a previously emitted sequence number.

## VAA Format

The basic VAA consists of header and body components described as follows:

- **Header** - holds metadata about the current VAA, the Guardian set that is currently active, and the list of signatures gathered so far
    - `version` ++"byte"++ - the VAA Version
    - `guardian_set_index` ++"u32"++ - indicates which Guardian set is signing
    - `len_signatures` ++"u8"++ - the number of signatures stored
    - `signatures` ++"[]signature"++ - the collection of Guardian signatures

    Where each `signature` is:

    - `index` ++"u8"++ - the index of this Guardian in the Guardian set
    - `signature` ++"[65]byte"++ - the ECDSA signature

- **Body** - _deterministically_ derived from an on-chain message. Any two Guardians processing the same message must derive the same resulting body to maintain a one-to-one relationship between VAAs and messages to avoid double-processing messages
    - `timestamp` ++"u32"++ - the timestamp of the block this message was published in
    - `nonce` ++"u32"++
    - `emitter_chain` ++"u16"++ - the id of the chain that emitted the message
    - `emitter_address` ++"[32]byte"++ - the contract address (Wormhole formatted) that called the Core Contract
    - `sequence` ++"u64"++ - the auto-incrementing integer that represents the number of messages published by this emitter
    - `consistency_level` ++"u8"++ - the consistency level (finality) required by this emitter
    - `payload` ++"[]byte"++ - arbitrary bytes containing the data to be acted on

The deterministic nature of the body is only strictly true once the chain's state is finalized. If a reorg occurs, and a transaction that previously appeared in block X is replaced by block Y, Guardians observing different forks may generate different VAAs for what the emitter contract believes is the same message. This scenario is less likely once a block is sufficiently buried, but it can still happen if you choose a faster (less finalized) consistency level

The body contains relevant information for entities, such as contracts or other systems, that process or utilize VAAs. When a function like `parseAndVerifyVAA` is called, the body is returned, allowing verification of the `emitterAddress` to determine if the VAA originated from a trusted contract.

Because VAAs have no destination, they are effectively multicast. Any Core Contract on any chain in the network will verify VAAs as authentic. If a VAA has a specific destination, relayers are responsible for appropriately completing that delivery.

## Consistency and Finality

The consistency level determines whether Guardians wait for a chain's final commitment state or issue a VAA sooner under less-final conditions. This choice is especially relevant for blockchains without instant finality, where the risk of reorganization remains until a block is deeply confirmed. 

Guardian watchers are specialized processes that monitor each blockchain in real-time. They enforce the selected consistency level by deciding whether enough commitment has been reached before signing and emitting a VAA. Some chains allow only one commitment level (effectively final), while others let integrators pick between near-final or fully finalized states. Choosing a faster option speeds up VAA production but increases reorg risk. A more conservative option takes longer but reduces the likelihood of rollback.

## Signatures

The body of the VAA is hashed twice with `keccak256` to produce the signed digest message.

```js
// hash the bytes of the body twice
digest = keccak256(keccak256(body))
// sign the result 
signature = ecdsa_sign(digest, key)
```

!!!tip "Hash vs. double hash"
    Different implementations of the ECDSA signature validation may apply a keccak256 hash to the message passed, so care must be taken to pass the correct arguments.
    
    For example, the [Solana secp256k1 program](https://docs.solanalabs.com/runtime/programs#secp256k1-program){target=\_blank} will hash the message passed. In this case, the argument for the message should be a single hash of the body, not the twice-hashed body.

## Payload Types

Different applications built on Wormhole may specify a format for the payloads attached to a VAA. This payload provides information on the target chain and contract so it can take action (e.g., minting tokens to a receiver address).

### Token Transfer

Many bridges use a lockup/mint and burn/unlock mechanism to transfer tokens between chains. Wormhole's generic message-passing protocol handles the routing of lock and burn events across chains to ensure Wormhole's Token Bridge is chain-agnostic and can be rapidly integrated into any network with a Wormhole contract.

Transferring tokens from the sending chain to the destination chain requires the following steps:

1. Lock the token on the sending chain
2. The sending chain emits a message as proof the token lockup is complete
3. The destination chain receives the message confirming the lockup event on the sending chain
4. The token is minted on the destination chain

The message the sending chain emits to verify the lockup is referred to as a transfer message and has the following structure:

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ - the ID of the payload. This should be set to `1` for a token transfer
- `amount` ++"u256"++ - amount of tokens being transferred
- `token_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the source chain
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the source chain
- `to` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the destination chain
- `to_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the destination chain
- `fee` ++"u256"++ - portion of amount paid to a relayer

This structure contains everything the destination chain needs to learn about a lockup event. Once the destination chain receives this payload, it can mint the corresponding asset.

Note that the destination chain is agnostic regarding how the tokens on the sending side were locked. They could have been burned by a mint or locked in a custody account. The protocol relays the event once enough Guardians have attested to its existence.

### Attestation

While the destination chain can trust the message from the sending chain to inform it of token lockup events, it has no way of verifying the correct token is locked up. To solve this, the Token Bridge supports token attestation.

To create a token attestation, the sending chain emits a message containing metadata about a token, which the destination chain may use to preserve the name, symbol, and decimal precision of a token address.

The message format for token attestation is as follows:

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ - the ID of the payload. This should be set to `2` for an attestation
- `token_address` ++"[32]byte"++ - address of the originating token contract
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - chain ID of the originating token 
- `decimals` ++"u8"++ - number of decimals this token should have
- `symbol` ++"[32]byte"++ - short name of asset
- `name` ++"[32]byte"++ - full name of asset

#### Attestation Tips 

Be aware of the following considerations when working with attestations:

- Attestations use a fixed-length byte array to encode UTF8 token name and symbol data. Because the byte array is fixed length, the data contained may truncate multibyte Unicode characters

- When sending an attestation VAA, it is recommended to send the longest UTF8 prefix that doesn't truncate a character and then right-pad it with zero bytes

- When parsing an attestation VAA, it is recommended to trim all trailing zero bytes and convert the remainder to UTF-8 via any lossy algorithm

- Be mindful that different on-chain systems may have different VAA parsers, resulting in different names/symbols on different chains if the string is long or contains invalid UTF8

- Without knowing a token's decimal precision, the destination chain cannot correctly mint the number of tokens when processing a transfer. For this reason, the Token Bridge requires an attestation for each token transfer

### Token Transfer with Message

The Token Transfer with Message data structure is identical to the token-only data structure, except for the following:

- **`fee` field** - replaced with the `from_address` field 
- **`payload` field** - is added containing arbitrary bytes. A dApp may include additional data in this arbitrary byte field to inform some application-specific behavior

This VAA type was previously known as Contract Controlled Transfer and is also sometimes referred to as a `payload3` message. The Token Transfer with Message data sructure is as follows:

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ -  the ID of the payload. This should be set to `3` for a token transfer with message 
- `amount` ++"u256"++ - amount of tokens being transferred
- `token_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the source chain
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the source chain
- `to` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the destination chain
- `to_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the destination chain
- `from_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address that called the Token Bridge on the source chain
- `payload` ++"[]byte"++ - message, arbitrary bytes, app-specific

### Governance

Governance VAAs don't have a `payload_id` field like the preceding formats. Instead, they trigger an action in the deployed contracts (for example, an upgrade).

#### Action Structure

Governance messages contain pre-defined actions, which can target the various Wormhole modules currently deployed on-chain. The structure includes the following fields:

- `module` ++"u8[32]"++ - contains a right-aligned module identifier
- `action` ++"u8"++ - predefined governance action to execute
- `chain`  ++"u16"++ - chain the action is targeting. This should be set to `0` for all chains
- `args`  ++"any"++ - arguments to the action

Below is an example message containing a governance action triggering a code upgrade to the Solana Core Contract. The module field here is a right-aligned encoding of the ASCII Core, represented as a 32-byte hex string.

```js
module:       0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000436f7265
action:       1
chain:        1
new_contract: 0x348567293758957162374959376192374884562522281937446234828323
```

#### Actions

The meaning of each numeric action is pre-defined and documented in the Wormhole design documents. For each application, the relevant definitions can be found via these links:

- [Core governance actions](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0002_governance_messaging.md){target=\_blank}
- [Token Bridge governance actions](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0003_token_bridge.md){target=\_blank}

## Lifetime of a Message

Anyone can submit a VAA to the target chain. Guardians typically don't perform this step to avoid transaction fees. Instead, applications built on top of Wormhole can acquire a VAA via the Guardian RPC and submit it in a separate flow.

With the concepts now defined, it is possible to illustrate a full flow for message passing between two chains. The following stages demonstrate each step of processing that the Wormhole network performs to route a message.

1. **A message is emitted by a contract running on Chain A** - any contract can emit messages, and the Guardians are programmed to observe all chains for these events. Here, the Guardians are represented as a single entity to simplify the graphics, but the observation of the message must be performed individually by each of the 19 Guardians
2. **Signatures are aggregated** - Guardians independently observe and sign the message. Once enough Guardians have signed the message, the collection of signatures is combined with the message and metadata to produce a VAA
3. **VAA submitted to target chain** - the VAA acts as proof that the Guardians have collectively attested the existence of the message payload. The VAA is submitted (or relayed) to the target chain to be processed by a receiving contract and complete the final step

# Introduction to Wormhole

In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, interoperability between different blockchains remains a significant challenge. Developers often face hurdles in creating applications that can seamlessly operate across multiple blockchains, limiting innovation and the potential of decentralized ecosystems.

Wormhole addresses this problem by providing a _generic message-passing_ protocol that enables secure and efficient communication between blockchains. By allowing data and asset transfers across various blockchain networks, Wormhole breaks down the walls that traditionally separate these ecosystems.

Wormhole is distinguished by its focus on robust security, scalability, and transparency. The protocol is supported by a decentralized network of validators that ensure the integrity of every cross-chain transaction. This, combined with Wormhole’s proven performance in real-world applications, gives developers a dependable platform to create and scale multichain applications confidently.

![Message-passing process in the Wormhole protocol](/docs/images/protocol/introduction/introduction-1.webp)

!!! note
    The above is an oversimplified illustration of the protocol; details about the architecture and components are available on the [architecture page](/docs/protocol/architecture/){target=\_blank}.

Wormhole allows developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchain ecosystems without being confined to one. This means applications can benefit from the unique features of various networks—such as Solana's high throughput, Ethereum's security, and Cosmos's interoperability while maintaining a unified, efficient user experience.

This page introduces the key concepts and components necessary to understand how Wormhole enables fast, secure, and scalable cross-chain communication.

## What Problems Does Wormhole Solve?

Interoperability is a critical challenge in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Individual blockchains are often isolated, limiting the potential for integrated applications operating across multiple ecosystems. Wormhole solves this problem by enabling seamless communication between blockchains, allowing developers to create multichain applications that can leverage the unique features of each network.

Critical problems Wormhole addresses include:

- **Blockchain isolation**: Wormhole connects disparate blockchains, enabling the transfer of assets, data, and governance actions across networks.
- **Cross-chain complexity**: By abstracting the complexities of cross-chain communication, Wormhole makes it easier for developers to build and deploy cross-chain applications.
- **Security and decentralization**: Wormhole prioritizes security through a decentralized Guardian network that validates and signs messages, ensuring the integrity of cross-chain interactions.

## What Does Wormhole Offer?

Wormhole provides a suite of tools and protocols that support a wide range of use cases:

- **Cross-chain messaging**: Securely transfer arbitrary data between blockchains, enabling the development of cross-chain decentralized applications.
- **Asset transfers**: Facilitate the movement of tokens and NFTs across supported chains with ease, powered by protocols built on Wormhole like [Portal](https://portalbridge.com/){target=\_blank}.
- **Developer tools**: Leverage Wormhole’s [TypeScript SDK](/docs/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/){target=\_blank}, [Solidity SDK](/docs/tools/solidity-sdk/get-started/), [Wormholescan](https://wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}, and the [Wormholescan API](https://wormholescan.io/#/developers/api-doc){target=\_blank} and documentation to build and deploy cross-chain applications quickly and efficiently.

## What Isn't Wormhole?

- **Wormhole is _not_ a blockchain**: It acts as a communication layer that connects different blockchains, enabling them to interact without being a blockchain itself.
- **Wormhole is _not_ a token bridge**: While it facilitates token transfers, Wormhole also supports a wide range of cross-chain applications, making it much more versatile than a typical bridge.

## Use Cases of Wormhole

Consider the following examples of potential applications enabled by Wormhole:

- **Cross-chain exchange**: Using [Wormhole Connect](/docs/products/connect/overview/){target=\_blank}, developers can build exchanges that allow deposits from any Wormhole-connected chain, significantly increasing liquidity access.
- **[Cross-chain governance](https://wormhole.com/blog/stake-for-governance-is-now-live-for-w-token-holders){target=\_blank}**: NFT collections on different networks can use Wormhole to communicate votes cast on their respective chains to a designated "voting" chain for combined proposals
- **Cross-chain game**: Games can be developed on a performant network like Solana, with rewards issued as NFTs on another network, such as Ethereum.

# Security

## Core Security Assumptions

At its core, Wormhole is secured by a network of [Guardian](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} nodes that validate and sign messages. If a super majority (e.g., 13 out of 19) of Guardians sign the same message, it can be considered valid. A smart contract on the target chain will verify the signatures and format of the message before approving any transaction.

- Wormhole's core security primitive is its signed messages (signed [VAAs](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank})
- The Guardian network is currently secured by a collection of 19 of the world's top [validator companies](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}
- Guardians produce signed state attestations (signed VAAs) when requested by a Core Contract integrator
- Every Guardian runs full nodes (rather than light nodes) of every blockchain in the Wormhole network, so if a blockchain suffers a consensus attack or hard fork, the blockchain will disconnect from the network rather than potentially produce invalid signed VAAs
- Any Signed VAA can be verified as authentic by the Core Contract of any other chain
- [Relayers](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank} are considered untrusted in the Wormhole ecosystem

In summary:

- **Core integrators aren't exposed to risk from chains and contracts they don't integrate with**
- By default, you only trust Wormhole's signing process and the core contracts of the chains you're on
- You can expand your contract and chain dependencies as you see fit

Core assumptions aside, many other factors impact the real-world security of decentralized platforms. Here is more information on additional measures that have been put in place to ensure the security of Wormhole.

## Guardian Network

Wormhole is an evolving platform. While the Guardian set currently comprises 19 validators, this is a limitation of current blockchain technology.

### Governance

Governance is the process through which contract upgrades happen. Guardians manually vote on governance proposals that originate inside the Guardian Network and are then submitted to ecosystem contracts.

This means that governance actions are held to the same security standard as the rest of the system. A two-thirds supermajority of the Guardians is required to pass any governance action.

Governance messages can target any of the various wormhole modules, including the core contracts and all currently deployed token bridge contracts. When a Guardian signs such a message, its signature implies a vote on the action in question. Once more than two-thirds of the Guardians have signed, the message and governance action are considered valid.

All governance actions and contract upgrades have been managed via Wormhole's on-chain governance system.

Via governance, the Guardians can:

- Change the current Guardian set
- Expand the Guardian set
- Upgrade ecosystem contract implementations

The governance system is fully open source in the core repository. See the [Open Source section](#open-source){target=\_blank} for contract source.

## Monitoring

A key element of Wormhole's defense-in-depth strategy is that each Guardian is a highly competent validator company with its own in-house processes for running, monitoring, and securing blockchain operations. This heterogeneous approach to monitoring increases the likelihood that fraudulent activity is detected and reduces the number of single failure points in the system.

Guardians are not just running Wormhole validators; they're running validators for every blockchain inside of Wormhole as well, which allows them to perform monitoring holistically across decentralized computing rather than just at a few single points.

Guardians monitor:

- Block production and consensus of each blockchain - if a blockchain's consensus is violated, it will be disconnected from the network until the Guardians resolve the issue
- Smart contract level data - via processes like the Governor, Guardians constantly monitor the circulating supply and token movements across all supported blockchains
- Guardian level activity - the Guardian Network functions as an autonomous decentralized computing network, ensuring independent security measures across its validators

## Asset Layer Protections

One key strength of the Wormhole ecosystem is the Guardians’ ability to validate and protect the integrity of assets across multiple blockchains.

To enforce the Wormhole Asset Layer’s core protections, the Global Accountant tracks the total circulating supply of all Wormhole assets across all chains, preventing any blockchain from bridging assets that could violate the supply invariant.

In addition to the Global Accountant, Guardians may only sign transfers that do not violate the requirements of the Governor. The [Governor](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0007_governor.md){target=\_blank} tracks inflows and outflows of all blockchains and delays suspicious transfers that may indicate an exploit.

## Open Source

Wormhole builds in the open and is always open source.

# Get Started with the Solidity SDK

The [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank} provides Solidity interfaces, prebuilt contracts, and testing tools to help Solidity developers build on-chain Wormhole integrations via smart contracts. You can use the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](/docs/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/){target=\_blank} for off-chain integrations without writing Solidity.

## Install the SDK

### Create and Deploy Contracts

This project uses sender and receiver contracts to access the `WormholeRelayer` interface's [`TokenSender`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/baa085006586a43c42858d355e3ffb743b80d7a4/src/WormholeRelayer/TokenBase.sol#L24){target=\_blank} and [`TokenReceiver`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/baa085006586a43c42858d355e3ffb743b80d7a4/src/WormholeRelayer/TokenBase.sol#L147){target=\_blank} base classes to simplify sending tokens across chains.

Follow these steps to create and deploy your sender and receiver Solidity contracts:

1. Use the following example code to create `CrossChainSender.sol`:

    ```solidity title="CrossChainSender.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol";
import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol";

    ) TokenBase(_wormholeRelayer, _tokenBridge, _wormhole) {}

    // Calculate the estimated cost for multichain token transfer using
    // the wormholeRelayer to get the delivery cost and add the message fee
    function quoteCrossChainDeposit(
        uint16 targetChain
    ) public view returns (uint256 cost) {
        uint256 deliveryCost;
        (deliveryCost, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
            targetChain,
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT
        );

        cost = deliveryCost + wormhole.messageFee();
    }

    // Send tokens and payload to the recipient on the target chain
    function sendCrossChainDeposit(
        uint16 targetChain,
        address targetReceiver,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        address token
    ) public payable {
        // Calculate the estimated cost for the multichain deposit
        uint256 cost = quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain);
        require(
            msg.value == cost,
            "msg.value must equal quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain)"
        );
        // Transfer the tokens from the sender to this contract
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        // Encode the recipient address into the payload
        bytes memory payload = abi.encode(recipient);
        // Initiate the multichain transfer using the wormholeRelayer
        sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm(
            targetChain,
            targetReceiver,
            payload,
            0,
            GAS_LIMIT,
            token,
            amount
        );
    }
}
    ```

    This contract extends `TokenSender`, gaining access to its functionality. It initializes the contract with the required addresses, calculates estimated transfer costs, defines transfer parameters, and initiates the transfer using the `sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm` function from `WormholeRelayer`.

2. Use the following example code to create `CrossChainReceiver.sol`:

    ```solidity title="CrossChainSender.sol"
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol";
import "lib/wormhole-solidity-sdk/src/interfaces/IERC20.sol";

// Extend the TokenReceiver contract inherited from TokenBase
contract CrossChainReceiver is TokenReceiver {
    // Initialize the contract with the Wormhole relayer, Token Bridge,
    // and Wormhole Core Contract addresses
    constructor(
        address _wormholeRelayer,
        address _tokenBridge,
        address _wormhole
    ) TokenBase(_wormholeRelayer, _tokenBridge, _wormhole) {}

    // Receive the multichain payload and tokens
    // Verify the transfer is from a registered sender
    function receivePayloadAndTokens(
        bytes memory payload,
        TokenReceived[] memory receivedTokens,
        bytes32 sourceAddress,
        uint16 sourceChain,
        bytes32 // deliveryHash
    )
        internal
        override
        onlyWormholeRelayer
        isRegisteredSender(sourceChain, sourceAddress)
    {
        // Ensure the payload is not empty and only has one token transfer
        require(receivedTokens.length == 1, "Expected 1 token transfer");

        // Decode the recipient address from the payload
        address recipient = abi.decode(payload, (address));

        // Transfer the received tokens to the intended recipient
        IERC20(receivedTokens[0].tokenAddress).transfer(
            recipient,
            receivedTokens[0].amount
        );
    }
}
    ```

    This contract extends `TokenReceiver`, gaining access to its functionality. It initializes the contract with the required addresses, receives the payload and tokens, verifies the transfer is from a registered sender, decodes the recipient address, and transfers the tokens to the recipient.

3. Deploy the contracts using your preferred deployment method. Make sure you deploy `CrossChainSender.sol` to your desired source chain and `CrossChainReceiver.sol` to the target chain. Save the deployed contract addresses for each contract. You will need them for your transfer script.

##  Use Contracts to Transfer USDC

1. Once your contracts are deployed, create a `transfer.ts` file to handle the multichain transfer logic:

    ```bash
    touch script/transfer.ts
    ```

2. Set up secure access to your wallets. This guide assumes you are loading your private key(s) from a secure keystore of your choice, such as a secrets manager or a CLI-based tool like [`cast wallet`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-wallet){target=\_blank}.

    !!! warning
        If you use a `.env` file during development, add it to your `.gitignore` to exclude it from version control. Never commit private keys or mnemonics to your repository.

3. Open `transfer.ts` and add the following code:

    ```typescript title="transfer.ts"
    import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import readlineSync from 'readline-sync';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { wormhole, chainToChainId } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk';
import evm from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk/evm';

// Replace with your contract address and chain names
const AVALANCHE_SENDER_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_AVALANCHE_SENDER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const CELO_RECEIVER_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_CELO_RECEIVER_ADDRESS';
const AVALANCHE_CHAIN_NAME = 'Avalanche';
const CELO_CHAIN_NAME = 'Celo';

// Fetch the contract ABI from the local filesystem
// This example uses the `out` directory from a Foundry deployment
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
const SENDER_ABI_PATH = path.resolve(
  __dirname,
  '../out/CrossChainSender.sol/CrossChainSender.json'
);

(async function () {
  try {
    console.log('Initializing Wormhole SDK...');
    const wh = await wormhole('Testnet', [evm]);
    const sendChain = wh.getChain(AVALANCHE_CHAIN_NAME);
    const rcvChain = wh.getChain(CELO_CHAIN_NAME);

    // The EVM_PRIVATE_KEY value must be loaded securely beforehand,
    // for example via a keystore, secrets manager, or environment variables
    // (not recommended)
    const EVM_PRIVATE_KEY = EVM_PRIVATE_KEY!;
    if (!EVM_PRIVATE_KEY) {
      console.error('EVM_PRIVATE_KEY is not set in your .env file.');
      process.exit(1);
    }

    // Get the RPC URL or Provider from the SDK
    const sourceRpcOrProvider = await sendChain.getRpc();
    let sourceProvider: ethers.JsonRpcProvider;
    if (
      sourceRpcOrProvider &amp;&amp;
      typeof (sourceRpcOrProvider as any).getBlockNumber === 'function'
    ) {
      sourceProvider = sourceRpcOrProvider as ethers.JsonRpcProvider;
    } else if (typeof sourceRpcOrProvider === 'string') {
      sourceProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(sourceRpcOrProvider);
    } else if (
      Array.isArray(sourceRpcOrProvider) &amp;&amp;
      typeof sourceRpcOrProvider[0] === 'string'
    ) {
      sourceProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(sourceRpcOrProvider[0]);
    } else {
      console.error(
        'Could not get a valid RPC URL or Provider from SDK:',
        sourceRpcOrProvider
      );
      process.exit(1);
    }

    // Create the wallet using the provider and private key
    const sourceWallet = new ethers.Wallet(EVM_PRIVATE_KEY, sourceProvider);

    // Load the sender contract ABI
    if (!fs.existsSync(SENDER_ABI_PATH)) {
      console.error(`ABI file not found at ${SENDER_ABI_PATH}`);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    const CrossChainSenderArtifact = JSON.parse(
      fs.readFileSync(SENDER_ABI_PATH, 'utf8')
    );
    const senderAbi = CrossChainSenderArtifact.abi;

    // Create new sender contract instance
    const senderContract = new ethers.Contract(
      AVALANCHE_SENDER_ADDRESS,
      senderAbi,
      sourceWallet
    );

    // Get user input for token transfer parameters
    const tokenAddress = readlineSync.question(
      'Enter the (ERC20) token contract address on Avalanche: '
    );
    const recipientAddress = readlineSync.question(
      'Enter the recipient address on Celo: '
    );
    const amountStr = readlineSync.question(
      'Enter the amount of tokens to transfer: '
    );

    // Approve sending tokens from the source wallet to the sender contract
    const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(
      tokenAddress,
      [
        'function decimals() view returns (uint8)',
        'function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)',
        'function allowance(address owner, address spender) view returns (uint256)',
      ],
      sourceWallet
    );

    // Convert the amount to the correct units based on token decimals
    const decimals = Number(await tokenContract.decimals());
    const amountToTransfer = ethers.parseUnits(amountStr, decimals);

    // Get a transfer cost quote
    const targetChainId = chainToChainId(rcvChain.chain);
    const cost = await senderContract.quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChainId);
    // Approve the sender contract to spend the tokens
    const approveTx = await tokenContract.approve(
      AVALANCHE_SENDER_ADDRESS,
      amountToTransfer
    );
    await approveTx.wait();

    // Initiate the transfer
    console.log(
      `Initiating cross-chain transfer to ${CELO_RECEIVER_ADDRESS} on ${rcvChain.chain}...`
    );
    const transferTx = await senderContract.sendCrossChainDeposit(
      targetChainId,
      CELO_RECEIVER_ADDRESS,
      recipientAddress,
      amountToTransfer,
      tokenAddress,
      { value: cost }
    );
    console.log(`Transfer transaction sent: ${transferTx.hash}`);
    await transferTx.wait();
    console.log(`✅ Transfer initiated successfully!`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }

  process.exit(0);
})();
    ```

    This script defines the sender and receiver contract addresses, fetches the necessary ABI information, creates a connected signer, converts decimals, calculates the estimated transfer cost, and initiates the token transfer.

3. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx tsx script/transfer.ts
    ```

4. Follow the prompts in the terminal. This example uses Avalanche Fuji as the source chain, Celo Testnet as the target, [Avalanche Fuji testnet USDC](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/usdc-on-test-networks){target=\_blank}, and a developer wallet as the recipient address. You will see terminal output similar to the following:

    <div data-termynal="" id="termynal">
<span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx script/transfer.ts</span>
<span data-ty="">Initializing Wormhole SDK...</span>

</div>

# Wormhole Finality

The following table documents each chain's `consistencyLevel` values (i.e., finality reached before signing). The consistency level defines how long the Guardians should wait before signing a VAA. The finalization time depends on the specific chain's consensus mechanism. The consistency level is a `u8`, so any single byte may be used. However, a small subset has particular meanings. If the `consistencyLevel` isn't one of those specific values, the `Otherwise` column describes how it's interpreted.

!!!note  
    Read-only deployments allow Wormhole messages to be received on chains not fully integrated with Wormhole Guardians. These deployments support cross-chain data verification but cannot originate messages. For example, a governance message can be sent from a fully integrated chain and processed on a read-only chain, but the read-only chain cannot send messages back.

# Wormhole Formatted Addresses

## Introduction

Wormhole formatted addresses are 32-byte hex representations of addresses from any supported blockchain. Whether an address originates from EVM, Solana, Cosmos, or another ecosystem, Wormhole standardizes all addresses into this format to ensure cross-chain compatibility.

This uniform format is essential for smooth interoperability in token transfers and messaging across chains. Wormhole uses formatted addresses throughout the [Wormhole SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank}, especially in cross-chain transactions, such as transfer functions that utilize the `bytes32` representation for recipient addresses.

## Platform-Specific Address Formats

Each blockchain ecosystem Wormhole supports has its method for formatting native addresses. To enable cross-chain compatibility, Wormhole converts these native addresses into the standardized 32-byte hex format.

Here’s an overview of the native address formats and how they are normalized to the Wormhole format:

| Platform        | Native Address Format            | Wormhole Formatted Address |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| EVM             |  Hex (e.g., 0x...)               |  32-byte Hex               |
| Solana          |  Base58                          |  32-byte Hex               |
| CosmWasm        |  Bech32                          |  32-byte Hex               |
| Algorand        |  Algorand App ID                 |  32-byte Hex               |
| Sui             |  Hex                             |  32-byte Hex               |
| Aptos           |  Hex                             |  32-byte Hex               |
| Near            |  SHA-256                         |  32-byte Hex               |

These conversions allow Wormhole to interact seamlessly with various chains using a uniform format for all addresses.

### Address Format Handling

The Wormhole SDK provides mappings that associate each platform with its native address format. You can find this mapping in the Wormhole SDK file [`platforms.ts`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/007f61b27c650c1cf0fada2436f79940dfa4f211/core/base/src/constants/platforms.ts#L93-L102){target=\_blank}:

```typescript
const platformAddressFormatEntries = [
  ['Evm', 'hex'],
  ['Solana', 'base58'],
  ['Cosmwasm', 'bech32'],
  ['Algorand', 'algorandAppId'],
  ['Sui', 'hex'],
  ['Aptos', 'hex'],
  ['Near', 'sha256'],
];
```

These entries define how the [`UniversalAddress`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/007f61b27c650c1cf0fada2436f79940dfa4f211/core/definitions/src/universalAddress.ts#L23){target=\_blank} class handles different address formats based on the platform.

## Universal Address Methods

The `UniversalAddress` class is essential for working with Wormhole formatted addresses. It converts native blockchain addresses into the standardized 32-byte hex format used across Wormhole operations.

Key functions:

 - **`new UniversalAddress()`** - use the `UniversalAddress` constructor to convert native addresses into the Wormhole format

    ```typescript
    const universalAddress = new UniversalAddress('0x123...', 'hex');
    ```

 - **`toUniversalAddress()`** - converts a platform-specific address into the Wormhole formatted 32-byte hex address

    ```typescript
    const ethAddress: NativeAddress<'Evm'> = toNative('Ethereum', '0x0C9...');
    const universalAddress = ethAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
    ```

 - **`toNative()`** - converts the Wormhole formatted address back to a native address for a specific blockchain platform

    ```typescript
    const nativeAddress = universalAddress.toNative('Evm');
    ```

 - **`toString()`** - returns the Wormhole formatted address as a hex string, which can be used in various SDK operations

    ```typescript
    console.log(universalAddress.toString());
    ```

These methods allow developers to convert between native addresses and the Wormhole format, ensuring cross-chain compatibility.

## Convert Between Native and Wormhole Formatted Addresses

The Wormhole SDK allows developers to easily convert between native addresses and Wormhole formatted addresses when building cross-chain applications.

### Convert a Native Address to a Wormhole Formatted Address

Example conversions for EVM and Solana:

=== "EVM"

    ```typescript
    import { toNative } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core';

const ethAddress: NativeAddress&lt;'Evm'&gt; = toNative(
  'Ethereum',
  '0x0C99567DC6f8f1864cafb580797b4B56944EEd28'
);
const universalAddress = ethAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
console.log('Universal Address (EVM):', universalAddress);
    ```

=== "Solana"

    ```typescript
    import { toNative } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core';

const solAddress: NativeAddress&lt;'Solana'&gt; = toNative(
  'Solana',
  '6zZHv9EiqQYcdg52ueADRY6NbCXa37VKPngEHaokZq5J'
);
const universalAddressSol = solAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
console.log('Universal Address (Solana):', universalAddressSol);
    ```

The result is a standardized address format that is ready for cross-chain operations.

### Convert Back to Native Addresses

Below is how you can convert a Wormhole formatted address back to an EVM or Solana native address:

```typescript
const nativeAddressEvm = universalAddress.toNative('Evm');
console.log('EVM Native Address:', nativeAddressEvm);

const nativeAddressSolana = universalAddress.toNative('Solana');
console.log('Solana Native Address:', nativeAddressSolana);
```

These conversions ensure that your cross-chain applications can seamlessly handle addresses across different ecosystems.

## Use Cases for Wormhole Formatted Addresses

### Cross-chain Token Transfers

Cross-chain token transfers require addresses to be converted into a standard format. For example, when transferring tokens from Ethereum to Solana, the Ethereum address is converted into a Wormhole formatted address to ensure compatibility. After the transfer, the Wormhole formatted address is converted back into the Solana native format.

### Smart Contract Interactions

In smart contract interactions, especially when building dApps that communicate across multiple chains, Wormhole formatted addresses provide a uniform way to reference addresses. This ensures that addresses from different blockchains can interact seamlessly, whether you're sending messages or making cross-chain contract calls.

### DApp Development

For cross-chain dApp development, Wormhole formatted addresses simplify handling user wallet addresses across various blockchains. This allows developers to manage addresses consistently, regardless of whether they work with EVM, Solana, or another supported platform.

### Relayers and Infrastructure

Finally, relayers and infrastructure components, such as Wormhole Guardians, rely on the standardized format to efficiently process and relay cross-chain messages. A uniform address format simplifies operations, ensuring smooth interoperability across multiple blockchains.
