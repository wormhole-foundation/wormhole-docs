# Wormhole Queries FAQs

## What libraries are available to handle queries?

 - The [Query TypeScript SDK](https://npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk){target=\_blank} can be used to create query requests, mock query responses for testing, and parse query responses. The SDK also includes utilities for posting query responses

- The [Solidity `QueryResponseLib` library](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/libraries/QueryResponse.sol){target=\_blank} can be used to parse and verify query responses on EVM chains. See the [Solana Stake Pool](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-stake-pool){target=\_blank} repository as an example use case

- [`QueryRequestBuilder.sol`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/testing/QueryRequestBuilder.sol){target=\_blank} can be used for mocking query requests and responses in Forge tests

- The [Go query package](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/node/pkg/query){target=\_blank} can also be used to create query requests and parse query responses

!!! note
    A Rust SDK for Solana is being actively investigated by the Wormhole contributors. See the [Solana Queries Verification](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-verify){target=\_blank} repository as a proof of concept.

## Are there any query examples?

Certainly. You can find a complete guide on the [Use Queries page](/docs/build/queries/use-queries/){target=\_blank}. Additionally, you can find full code examples in the following repositories:

- [Basic Example Query Demo](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-demo/){target=\_blank}
- [Solana Stake Pool Example Query](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-stake-pool){target=\_blank}
- [Solana Program Derived Address (PDA) / Token Account Balance Example Query](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-pda){target=\_blank}
- [Solana Queries Verification Example](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-solana-verify){target=\_blank}

## What is the format of the response signature?

The Guardian node calculates an ECDSA signature using [`Sign` function of the crypto package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.10.21/crypto#Sign){target=\_blank} where the digest hash is:

```keccak256("query_response_0000000000000000000|"+keccak256(responseBytes))``` 

See the [Guardian Key Usage](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0009_guardian_key.md){target=\_blank} white paper for more background. Once this signature is created, the Guardian's index in the Guardian set is appended to the end.

!!! note
    If you are used to `ecrecover` you will notice that the `v` byte is `0` or `1` as opposed to `27` or `28`. The `signaturesToEvmStruct` method in the [Query TypeScript SDK](https://npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk){target=\_blank} accounts for this as well as structuring the signatures into an `IWormhole.SignatureStruct[]`.

## Can anyone run a query proxy server?

Permissions for Query Proxy are managed by the Guardians. The Guardian nodes are configured to only listen to a set of allow-listed proxies. However, it is possible that this restriction may be lifted in the future and/or more proxies could be added.

It is also important to note that the proxies don't impact the verifiability of the request or result, i.e., their role in the process is trustless.

## What Does Queries Offer over an RPC Service

Wormhole Queries provides on-demand, attested, on-chain, verifiable RPC results. Each Guardian independently executes the specified query and returns the result and their signature. The proxy handles aggregating the results and signatures, giving you a single result (all within one REST call) with a quorum of signatures suitable for on-chain submission, parsing, and verification using one of our examples or SDKs.

# Queries Overview {: #queries-overview }

Wormhole Guardians, who run full nodes for various connected chains, facilitate a new cross-chain query service that allows for on-demand attested responses to queries, bypassing the inefficiencies of traditional transaction-based data retrieval. This method is faster and cost-effective, eliminating the need for gas payments and transaction finality wait times.

!!! note
	Queries are currently in closed beta, though you can start developing today. Check out [Use Queries](/docs/build/queries/use-queries/){target=\_blank} and reach out to [Join the beta](https://forms.clickup.com/45049775/f/1aytxf-10244/JKYWRUQ70AUI99F32Q){target=\_blank}.

Wormhole Queries offers on-demand access to Guardian-attested on-chain data. The current implementation provides integrators with a simple REST endpoint to initiate an off-chain request via a proxy. The proxy then forwards the request to the Guardians and gathers a quorum of responses. The result returns the encoded response, including the request details and the Guardian signatures. The request validation performed by the query module includes a three step process that involves verifying the signature to ensure it has the correct prefix, confirming that the signer is authorized to execute query requests, and validating the legitimacy of all per-chain requests contained in the query. You can read more about Queries in the [white paper](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0013_ccq.md){target=\_blank}.

## The Flow of a Query {: #the-flow-of-a-query}

The general overview of a query's flow is as follows: an off-chain process sends HTTPS query requests to a Query Proxy, which validates and forwards them to the Guardians; these Guardians independently validate, sign, and return the response, with the entire process typically taking less than a second.

![The architecture flow of a query](/docs/images/build/queries/overview/overview-1.webp)

The step-by-step flow of a query is as follows:

1. An off-chain process initiates a query request via HTTPS to the query proxy (or Query Server) 
2. The query proxy validates the request and forwards it to the Guardians via a gossip network
3. The Guardians independently validate the request, make the requisite RPC calls, verify the results, sign, and gossip a response back to the Query Proxy
4. The Query Proxy aggregates the results and returns a response when it reaches a quorum of two-thirds or more of the current Guardian set - the exact quorum requirements as the core bridge
5. The off-chain process can then submit these requests to an on-chain contract which should verify the signatures and validate the request before processing the result

In this flow, the Query Proxy is a permissioned but trustless part of the protocol. In most cases, this entire process takes less than one second. If a request is invalid or cannot be processed by the Guardians, they will retry for up to one minute before timing out. Requests can be batched to have the Guardians make multiple calls to multiple networks. This can further reduce overhead for processing query responses on-chain. Up to 255 queries can be batched together, with certain types allowing for batching themselves.

## Supported Query Types {: #supported-query-types}

There are currently five supported types of queries. See [the white paper](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0013_ccq.md){target=\_blank} for more details on each.

### eth_call {: #eth-call}

This query type is effectively an equivalent of [eth_call](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_call){target=\_blank} against a block specified by number or hash.

Calls are batched to allow specifying multiple calls (even to multiple contracts) against the same block. These calls are included in a single batch RPC call, simplifying on-chain verification. Up to 255 calls may be batched in an single `eth_call` query.

The result contains the specified block number, hash, timestamp, and the call result.

### eth_call By Timestamp {: #eth-call-by-timestamp}

This query type is similar to `eth_call` but targets a timestamp instead of a specific `block_id`. This can be useful when forming requests based on uncorrelated data, such as requiring data from another chain based on the block timestamp of a given chain.

The result also contains the target and block details with the following enforced conditions: `target_block.timestamp <= target_time < following_block.timestamp` and `following_block_num - 1 == target_block_num`.

### eth_call With Finality {: #eth-call-with-finality}

This query type is similar to `eth_call` but ensures that the specified block has reached the specified finality before returning the query results. The finality may be `finalized` or `safe.` Note that if a chain doesn't natively support the `safe` tag, this will be equivalent to `finalized.`

### sol_account {: #sol_account}

This query is used to read data for one or more accounts on Solana, akin to [`getMultipleAccounts`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getmultipleaccounts){target=\_blank}.

### sol_pda {: #sol_pda}

This query is used to read data for one or more [Program Derived Addresses(PDA)](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/pdas){target=\_blank} on Solana, akin to calling [`getMultipleAccounts`](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getmultipleaccounts){target=\_blank} on the result of `PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(seeds, programId).` This query is helpful for times when you want to more generally read accounts owned by a program and verify the derivation on another chain, like how associated token accounts are all derived from the [Associated Token Account Program](https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account){target=\_blank}.

## Supported Chains {: #supported-chains}

The following table provides expected support based on testing. However, the success of any given query is based on the success of the underlying call on each Guardian’s RPC node.

For example, many chains have implementations forked from [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum){target=\_blank}, which keeps 128 blocks of state in memory by default (without running in archive mode). While this is good for about 25 minutes of history on Ethereum Mainnet, it is only about three minutes on Optimism. While Guardian nodes can be expected to have access to recent state, there are currently no guarantees of how far back in history they have access to.

# Use Queries

You can visit the [Example Queries Demo](https://wormholelabs-xyz.github.io/example-queries-demo/){target=\_blank} to view an interactive example of an application interacting with the [Query Demo](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-demo/blob/main/src/QueryDemo.sol){target=\_blank} contract.

This guide covers using a simple `eth_call` request to get the total supply of WETH on Ethereum.

## RPC Basics

Before digging into anything Queries-specific, this page will look at how to make an [`eth_call`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_call){target=\_blank} against a public Ethereum RPC. Suppose you'd like to query the WETH contract for its total supply; before making a request, you need some information about the contract you want to call, including:

- **To** - the contract to call. WETH is [0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2){target=\_blank}
- **Data** - the method identifier and ABI-encoded parameters, which can be obtained as follows: `web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("totalSupply()")` which yields `0x18160ddd`
- **Block ID** - the block number, hash, or tag. Tag options include `latest,` `safe,` or `finalized`

The prepared curl request is as follows:

```bash title="eth_call JSON-RPC request"
curl https://ethereum.publicnode.com -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_call","params":[{"to":"0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2","data":"0x18160ddd"},"latest"],"id":1}'
```

And the corresponding response is:

```bash title="eth_call JSON-RPC reponse"
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":1,
  "result":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000029fd3d129b582d7949e71"
}
```

Converting the returned value of the executed call from hexidecimal results in the value `3172615244782286193073777`. You can compare your result to the [**Read Contract**](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#readContract){target=\_blank} tab in Etherscan. Your result will be different as WETH is minted/burned over time.

## Construct a Query {: #construct-a-query}

You can use the [Wormhole Query SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk){target=\_blank} to construct a query. You will also need an RPC endpoint from the provider of your choice. This example uses [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios){target=\_blank} for RPC requests. Ensure that you also have [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/){target=\_blank} installed. 

```jsx
npm i @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk axios
```

In order to make an `EthCallQueryRequest`, you need a specific block number or hash as well as the call data to request.

You can request the latest block from a public node using `eth_getBlockByNumber`.

```jsx

await axios.post(rpc, {
      method: 'eth_getBlockByNumber',
      params: ['latest', false],
      id: 1,
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
    })
  ).data?.result?.number;
```

Then construct the call data.

```jsx
to: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2', // WETH
  data: '0x18160ddd', // web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("totalSupply()")
};
```

Finally, put it all together in a `QueryRequest`.

```jsx
const request = new QueryRequest(
    0, // Nonce
    [
      new PerChainQueryRequest(
        2, // Ethereum Wormhole Chain ID
        new EthCallQueryRequest(latestBlock, [callData])
      ),
    ]
  );
```

This request consists of one `PerChainQueryRequest`, which is an `EthCallQueryRequest` to Ethereum. You can use `console.log` to print the JSON object and review the structure.

```jsx

// {
//   "nonce": 0,
//   "requests": [
//     {
//       "chainId": 2,
//       "query": {
//         "callData": [
//           {
//             "to": "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
//             "data": "0x18160ddd"
//           }
//         ],
//         "blockTag": "0x11e9068"
//       }
//     }
//   ],
//   "version": 1
// }
```

## Mock a Query

For easier testing, the Query SDK provides a `QueryProxyMock` method. This method will perform the request and sign the result with the [Devnet](/docs/build/toolkit/tilt/){target=\_blank} Guardian key. The `mock` call returns the same format as the Query Proxy.

```jsx
const mockData = await mock.mock(request);
  console.log(mockData);
// {
//   signatures: ['...'],
//   bytes: '...'
// }
```

This response is suited for on-chain use, but the SDK also includes a parser to make the results readable via the client.

```jsx
const mockQueryResult = (
    mockQueryResponse.responses[0].response as EthCallQueryResponse
  ).results[0];
  console.log(
    `Mock Query Result: ${mockQueryResult} (${BigInt(mockQueryResult)})`
  );
// Mock Query Result: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000029fd09d4d81addb3ccfee (3172556167631284394053614)
```

Testing this all together might look like the following:

```jsx
import {
  EthCallData,
  EthCallQueryRequest,
  EthCallQueryResponse,
  PerChainQueryRequest,
  QueryProxyMock,
  QueryRequest,
  QueryResponse,
} from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-query-sdk';
import axios from 'axios';

const rpc = 'https://ethereum.publicnode.com';
const callData: EthCallData = {
  to: '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2', // WETH
  data: '0x18160ddd', // web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("totalSupply()")
};

(async () => {
  const latestBlock: string = (
    await axios.post(rpc, {
      method: 'eth_getBlockByNumber',
      params: ['latest', false],
      id: 1,
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
    })
  ).data?.result?.number;
  if (!latestBlock) {
    console.error(`❌ Invalid block returned`);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Latest Block:     ', latestBlock, `(${BigInt(latestBlock)})`);
  const targetResponse = await axios.post(rpc, {
    method: 'eth_call',
    params: [callData, latestBlock],
    id: 1,
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
  });
  // console.log(finalizedResponse.data);
  if (targetResponse.data.error) {
    console.error(`❌ ${targetResponse.data.error.message}`);
  }
  const targetResult = targetResponse.data?.result;
  console.log('Target Result:    ', targetResult, `(${BigInt(targetResult)})`);
  // Form the query request
  const request = new QueryRequest(
    0, // Nonce
    [
      new PerChainQueryRequest(
        2, // Ethereum Wormhole Chain ID
        new EthCallQueryRequest(latestBlock, [callData])
      ),
    ]
  );
  console.log(JSON.stringify(request, undefined, 2));
  const mock = new QueryProxyMock({ 2: rpc });
  const mockData = await mock.mock(request);
  console.log(mockData);
  const mockQueryResponse = QueryResponse.from(mockData.bytes);
  const mockQueryResult = (
    mockQueryResponse.responses[0].response as EthCallQueryResponse
  ).results[0];
  console.log(
    `Mock Query Result: ${mockQueryResult} (${BigInt(mockQueryResult)})`
  );
})();
```

### Fork Testing

It is common to test against a local fork of Mainnet with something like

```jsx
anvil --fork-url https://ethereum.publicnode.com
```

In order for mock requests to verify against the Mainnet Core Contract, you need to replace the current Guardian set with the single Devnet key used by the mock.

Here's an example for Ethereum Mainnet, where the `-a` parameter is the [Core Contract address](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#core-contracts){target=\_blank} on that chain.

```jsx
npx @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-cli evm hijack -a 0x98f3c9e6E3fAce36bAAd05FE09d375Ef1464288B -g 0xbeFA429d57cD18b7F8A4d91A2da9AB4AF05d0FBe
```

If you are using `EthCallWithFinality`, you will need to mine additional blocks (32 if using [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/){target=\_blank}) after the latest transaction for it to become finalized. Anvil supports [auto-mining](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/#mining-modes){target=\_blank} with the `-b` flag if you want to test code that waits naturally for the chain to advance. For integration tests, you may want to simply `anvil_mine` with `0x20`.

## Make a Query Request

The standardized means of making a `QueryRequest` with an API key is as follows:

```jsx
const serialized = request.serialize();
const proxyResponse = (await axios.post)<QueryProxyQueryResponse>(
  QUERY_URL,
  {
    bytes: Buffer.from(serialized).toString('hex'),
  },
  { headers: { 'X-API-Key': YOUR_API_KEY } }
);
```

Remember to always take steps to protect your sensitive API keys, such as defining them in `.env` files and including such files in your `.gitignore`.

A Testnet Query Proxy is available at `https://testnet.query.wormhole.com/v1/query`

A Mainnet Query Proxy is available at `https://query.wormhole.com/v1/query`

## Verify a Query Response On-Chain

A [`QueryResponseLib` library](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/libraries/QueryResponse.sol){target=\_blank} is provided to assist with verifying query responses. You can begin by installing the [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank} with the following command:

```bash
forge install wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk
```

Broadly, using a query response on-chain comes down to three main steps:

   1. Parse and verify the query response
   2. The `parseAndVerifyQueryResponse` handles verifying the Guardian signatures against the current Guardian set stored in the Core bridge contract
   3. Validate the request details. This may be different for every integrator depending on their use case, but generally checks the following:
    - Is the request against the expected chain?
    - Is the request of the expected type? The `parseEthCall` helpers perform this check when parsing
    - Is the resulting block number and time expected? Some consumers might require that a block number be higher than the last, or the block time be within the last 5 minutes. `validateBlockNum` and `validateBlockTime` can help with the checks
    - Is the request for the expected contract and function signature? The `validateMultipleEthCallData` can help with non-parameter-dependent cases
    - Is the result of the expected length for the expected result type?
   4. Run `abi.decode` on the result 

See the [QueryDemo](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-queries-demo/blob/main/src/QueryDemo.sol){target=\_blank} contract for an example and read the docstrings of the preceding methods for detailed usage instructions.

## Submit a Query Response On-Chain

The `QueryProxyQueryResponse` result requires a slight tweak when submitting to the contract to match the format of `function parseAndVerifyQueryResponse(bytes memory response, IWormhole.Signature[] memory signatures)`. A helper function, `signaturesToEvmStruct`, is provided in the SDK for this.

This example submits the transaction to the demo contract:

```jsx
const tx = await contract.updateCounters(
  `0x${response.data.bytes}`,
  signaturesToEvmStruct(response.data.signatures)
);
```

# Glossary

This glossary is an index of technical term definitions for words commonly used in Wormhole documentation.

## Chain ID

Wormhole assigns a unique `u16` integer chain ID to each supported blockchain. These chain IDs are specific to Wormhole and may differ from those used by blockchains to identify their networks.

You can find each chain ID documented on the [Wormhole Chain IDs](/docs/build/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} page.

## Consistency Level

The level of finality (consistency) a transaction should meet before being signed by a Guardian. See the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} reference page for details.

## Delivery Provider

A Delivery Provider monitors for Wormhole Relayer delivery requests and delivers those requests to the intended target chain as instructed.

## Emitter

The emitter contract makes the call to the Wormhole Core Contract. The published message includes the emitter contract address and, a sequence number for the message is tracked to provide a unique ID.

## Finality

The finality of a transaction depends on its blockchain properties. Once a transaction is considered final, you can assume the resulting state changes it caused won't be reverted.

## Guardian

A [Guardian](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} is one of the 19 parties running validators in the Guardian Network contributing to the VAA multisig.

## Guardian Network

Validators in their own P2P network who serve as Wormhole's oracle by observing activity on-chain and generating signed messages attesting to that activity.

## Guardian Set

The Guardian Set is a set of guardians responsible for validating a message emitted from the core contracts. Occasionally, the members of the set will change through a governance action.

## Heartbeat

Each Guardian will issue a `heartbeat` on a 15-second interval to signal that it is still running and convey details about its identity, uptime, version, and the status of the connected nodes.

You can view the heartbeats on the [Wormhole dashboard](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}.

## Observation

An Observation is a data structure describing a message emitted by the Core Contract and noticed by the Guardian node.

## Relayer

A relayer is any process that delivers VAAs to a destination.

## Sequence

A nonce, strictly increasing, which is tracked by the Wormhole Core Contract and unique to the emitter chain and address.

## Spy

A Spy is a daemon that eavesdrops on the messages passed between Guardians, typically to track VAAs as they get signed.

## VAA

[Verifiable Action Approvals](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} (VAAs) are the base data structure in the Wormhole ecosystem. They contain emitted messages along with information such as what contract emitted the message.

## Validator

A daemon configured to monitor a blockchain node and observe messages emitted by the Wormhole contracts.

# Architecture

## Overview

Wormhole has several noteworthy components. Before discussing each component in depth, this page will provide an overview of how the major pieces fit together.

![Wormhole architecture detailed diagram: source to target chain communication.](/docs/images/learn/infrastructure/architecture/architecture-1.webp)

The preceding diagram outlines the end-to-end flow of multichain communication through Wormhole's architecture, which is described as follows:

1. **Source chain** - a source contract emits a message by interacting with the [Wormhole Core Contract](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} on the source chain, which publishes the message in the blockchain's transaction logs
2. **Guardian Network** - [Guardians](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} validate these messages and sign them to produce [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}
3. **Relayers** - off-chain relayers or applications fetch the VAA and relay it to the target chain
4. **Target chain** - on the target chain, the message is consumed by the appropriate contract. This contract interacts with the Wormhole Core Contract to verify the VAA and execute the intended multichain operation. 

    The flow from the relayer to the target chain involves an entry point contract, which could vary based on the use case:

    - In some applications, the target contract acts as the entry point and performs verification via the Core Contract
    - In products like the Token Bridge, the Token Bridge contract itself interacts with the Core Contract

## On-Chain Components

- **Emitter** - a contract that calls the publish message method on the Core Contract. To identify the message, the Core Contract will write an event to the transaction logs with details about the emitter and sequence number. This may be your [xDapp](/docs/learn/glossary/#xdapp){target=\_blank} or an existing ecosystem protocol
- **[Wormhole Core Contract](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank}** - primary contract, this is the contract which the Guardians observe and which fundamentally allows for multichain communication
- **Transaction logs** - blockchain-specific logs that allow the Guardians to observe messages emitted by the Core Contract

## Off-Chain Components

- **Guardian Network** - validators that exist in their own P2P network. Guardians observe and validate the messages emitted by the Core Contract on each supported chain to produce VAAs (signed messages)
- **[Guardian](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank}** - one of 19 validators in the Guardian Network that contributes to the VAA multisig
- **[Spy](/docs/learn/infrastructure/spy/){target=\_blank}** - a daemon that subscribes to messages published within the Guardian Network. A Spy can observe and forward network traffic, which helps scale up VAA distribution
- **[API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}** - a REST server to retrieve details for a VAA or the Guardian Network
- **[VAAs](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}** - Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs) are the signed attestation of an observed message from the Wormhole Core Contract
- **[Relayer](/docs/learn/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank}** - any off-chain process that relays a VAA to the target chain
    - **Wormhole relayers** - a decentralized relayer network that delivers messages that are requested on-chain via the Wormhole relayer contract
    - **Custom relayers** - relayers that only handle VAAs for a specific protocol or multichain application. They can execute custom logic off-chain, reducing gas costs and increasing multichain compatibility. Currently, multichain application developers are responsible for developing and hosting custom relayers

# Core Contracts

## Introduction

The Wormhole Core Contract is deployed across each supported blockchain network. This contract is a fundamental component of the Wormhole interoperability protocol and acts as the foundational layer enabling secure and efficient multichain messaging. All multichain applications either interact directly with the Core Contract or with another contract that does.

This page summarizes the key functions of the Core Contract and outlines how the Core Contract works.

## Key Functions 

Key functions of the Wormhole Core Contract include the following:

- **Multichain messaging** - standardizes and secures the format of messages to facilitate consistent communication for message transfer between Wormhole-connected blockchain networks, allowing developers to leverage the unique features of each network
- **Verification and validation** - verifies and validates all VAAs received on the target chain by confirming the Guardian signature to ensure the message is legitimate and has not been manipulated or altered
- **Guardian Network coordination** - coordinates with Wormhole's Guardian Network to facilitate secure, trustless communication across chains and ensure that only validated interactions are processed to enhance the protocol's overall security and reliability
- **Event emission for monitoring**  - emits events for every multichain message processed, allowing for network activity monitoring like tracking message statuses, debugging, and applications that can react to multichain events in real time

## How the Core Contract Works

The Wormhole Core Contract is central in facilitating secure and efficient multichain transactions. It enables communication between different blockchain networks by packaging transaction data into standardized messages, verifying their authenticity, and ensuring they are executed correctly on the destination chain.

The following describes the role of the Wormhole Core Contract in message transfers:

1. **Message submission** - when a user initiates a multichain transaction, the Wormhole Core Contract on the source chain packages the transaction data into a standardized message payload and submits it to the Guardian Network for verification
2. **Guardian verification** - the Guardians independently observe and sign the message. Once enough Guardians have signed the message, the collection of signatures is combined with the message and metadata to produce a VAA
3. **Message reception and execution** - on the target chain, the Wormhole Core Contract receives the verified message, checks the Guardians' signatures, and executes the corresponding actions like minting tokens, updating states, or calling specific smart contract functions

For a closer look at how messages flow between chains and all of the components involved, you can refer to the [Architecture Overview](/docs/learn/infrastructure/architecture/) page.

### Message Submission

You can send multichain messages by calling a function against the source chain Core Contract, which then publishes the message. Message publishing strategies can differ by chain; however, generally, the Core Contract posts the following items to the blockchain logs:

- `emitterAddress` - the contract which made the call to publish the message
- `sequenceNumber` - a unique number that increments for every message for a given emitter (and implicitly chain)
- `consistencyLevel`- the level of finality to reach before the Guardians will observe and attest the emitted event. This is a defense against reorgs and rollbacks since a transaction, once considered "final,"  is guaranteed not to have the state changes it caused rolled back. Since different chains use different consensus mechanisms, each one has different finality assumptions, so this value is treated differently on a chain-by-chain basis. See the options for finality for each chain in the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} reference page

There are no fees to publish a message except when publishing on Solana, but this is subject to change in the future.

### Message Reception

When you receive a multichain message on the target chain Core Contract, you generally must parse and verify the [components of a VAA](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas#vaa-format){target=\_blank}. Receiving and verifying a VAA ensures that the Guardian Network properly attests to the message and maintains the integrity and authenticity of the data transmitted between chains.

## Multicast

Multicast refers to simultaneously broadcasting a single message or transaction across different blockchains with no destination address or chain for the sending and receiving functions. VAAs attest that "this contract on this chain said this thing." Therefore, VAAs are multicast by default and will be verified as authentic on any chain where they are used.

This multicast-by-default model makes it easy to synchronize state across the entire ecosystem. A blockchain can make its data available to every chain in a single action with low latency, which reduces the complexity of the n^2 problems encountered by routing data to many blockchains.

This doesn't mean an application _cannot_ specify a destination address or chain. For example, the [Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/){target=\_blank} and [Wormhole relayer](/docs/learn/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank} contracts require that some destination details be passed and verified on the destination chain.

Because the VAA creation is separate from relaying, the multicast model does not incur an additional cost when a single chain is targeted. If the data isn't needed on a certain blockchain, don't relay it there, and it won't cost anything.

## Guardian

Wormhole relies on a set of 19 distributed nodes that monitor the state on several blockchains. In Wormhole, these nodes are referred to as Guardians. The current Guardian set can be seen in the [Dashboard](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}.

Guardians fulfill their role in the messaging protocol as follows: 

1. Each Guardian observes messages and signs the corresponding payloads in isolation from the other Guardians
2. Guardians combine their indpendent signatures to form a multisig
3. This multisig represents proof that a majority of the Wormhole network has observed and agreed upon a state

Wormhole refers to these multisigs as [Verifiable Action Approvals](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} (VAAs).

## Guardian Network

The Guardian Network functions as Wormhole's decentralized oracle, ensuring secure, cross-chain interoperability. Learning about this critical element of the Wormhole ecosystem will help you better understand the protocol. 

The Guardian Network is designed to help Wormhole deliver on five key principles:

- **Decentralization** - control of the network is distributed across many parties
- **Modularity** - independent components (e.g., oracle, relayer, applications) ensure flexibility and upgradeability
- **Chain agnosticism** - supports EVM, Solana, and other blockchains without relying on a single network
- **Scalability** - can handle large transaction volumes and high-value transfers
- **Upgradeable** - can change the implementation of its existing modules without breaking integrators to adapt to changes in decentralized computing

The following sections explore each principle in detail. 

### Decentralization

Decentralization remains the core concern for interoperability protocols. Earlier solutions were fully centralized, and even newer models often rely on a single entity or just one or two actors, creating low thresholds for collusion or failure.

Two common approaches to decentralization have notable limitations:

- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** - while PoS is often seen as a go-to model for decentralization, it's not well-suited for a network that verifies many blockchains and doesn't run its own smart contracts. Its security in this context is unproven, and it introduces complexities that make other design goals harder to achieve
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** - ZKPs offer a trustless and decentralized approach, but the technology is still early-stage. On-chain verification is often too computationally expensive—especially on less capable chains—so a multisig-based fallback is still required for practical deployment

In the current De-Fi landscape, most major blockchains are secured by a small group of validator companies. Only a limited number of companies worldwide have the expertise and capital to run high-performance validators.

If a protocol could unite many of these top validator companies into a purpose-built consensus mechanism designed for interoperability, it would likely offer better performance and security than a token-incentivized network. The key question is: how many of them could Wormhole realistically involve?

To answer that, consider these key constraints and design decisions:

- **Threshold signatures allow flexibility, but** - with threshold signatures, in theory, any number of validators could participate. However, threshold signatures are not yet widely supported across blockchains. Verifying them is expensive and complex, especially in a chain-agnostic system
- **t-Schnorr multisig is more practical** - Wormhole uses [t-Schnorr multisig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature){target=\_blank}, which is broadly supported and relatively inexpensive to verify. However, verification costs scale linearly with the number of signers, so the size of the validator set needs to be carefully chosen
- **19 validators is the optimal tradeoff** - a set of 19 participants presents a practical compromise between decentralization and efficiency. With a two-thirds consensus threshold, only 13 signatures must be verified on-chain—keeping gas costs reasonable while ensuring strong security
- **Security through reputation, not tokens** - Wormhole relies on a network of established validator companies instead of token-based incentives. These 19 Guardians are among the most trusted operators in the industry—real entities with a track record, not anonymous participants

This forms the foundation for a purpose-built Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus model, where each Guardian has an equal stake. As threshold signatures gain broader support, the set can expand. Once ZKPs become widely viable, the network can evolve into a fully trustless system.

### Modularity

Wormhole is designed with simple components that are very good at a single function. Separating security and consensus (Guardians) from message delivery ([relayers](/docs/learn/infrastructure/relayer/){target=\_blank}) allows for the flexibility to change or upgrade one component without disrupting the others.

### Chain Agnosticism

Today, Wormhole supports a broader range of ecosystems than any other interoperability protocol because it uses simple tech (t-schnorr signatures), an adaptable, heterogeneous relayer model, and a robust validator network. Wormhole can expand to new ecosystems as quickly as a [Core Contract](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} can be developed for the smart contract runtime.

### Scalability

Wormhole scales well, as demonstrated by its ability to handle substantial total value locked (TVL) and transaction volume even during tumultuous events.

Every Guardian must run a full node for every blockchain in the ecosystem. This requirement can be computationally heavy to set up; however, once all the full nodes are running, the Guardian Network's actual computation needs become lightweight. 

Performance is generally limited by the speed of the underlying blockchains, not the Guardian Network itself.

### Upgradeable

Wormhole is designed to adapt and evolve in the following ways:

- **Guardian Set expansion** – future updates may introduce threshold signatures to allow for more Guardians in the set
- **ZKP integration** - as Zero-Knowledge Proofs become more widely supported, the network can transition to a fully trustless model

These principles combine to create a clear pathway towards a fully trustless interoperability layer that spans decentralized computing.

# Relayers

This page provides a comprehensive guide to relayers within the Wormhole network, describing their role, types, and benefits in facilitating cross-chain processes.

Relayers in the Wormhole context are processes that deliver [Verified Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} to their destination, playing a crucial role in Wormhole's security model. They can't compromise security, only availability, and act as delivery mechanisms for VAAs without the capacity to tamper with the outcome.

There are three primary types of relayers discussed:

- **Client-side relaying** - a cost-efficient, no-backend-infrastructure approach relying on user-facing front ends. It provides a simple solution, although it can complicate the user experience due to the manual steps involved

- **Custom relayers** - backend components that handle parts of the cross-chain process, offering a smoother user experience and allowing off-chain calculations to reduce gas costs. These relayers could operate through direct listening to the Guardian Network (Spy relaying)

- **Wormhole-deployed relayers** - a decentralized relayer network that can deliver arbitrary VAAs, reducing the developer's need to develop, host, or maintain relayers. However, they require all calculations to be done on-chain and might be less gas-efficient

## Fundamentals

This section highlights the crucial principles underpinning the operation and handling of relayers within the Wormhole network.

Relayers are fundamentally trustless entities within the network, meaning while they don't require your trust to operate, you also shouldn't trust them implicitly. Relayers function as delivery mechanisms, transporting VAAs from their source to their destination.

Key characteristics of VAAs include:

- Public emission from the Guardian Network

- Authentication through signatures from the Guardian Network

- Verifiability by any entity or any Wormhole Core Contract

These characteristics mean anyone can pick up a VAA and deliver it anywhere, but no one can alter the VAA content without invalidating the signatures. 

Keep in mind the following security considerations around relayers:

- **Trusting information** - it is crucial not to trust information outside your contract or a VAA. Relying on information from a relayer could expose you to input attacks

- **Gas optimization** - using relayers to perform trustless off-chain computation to pass into the destination contract can optimize gas costs but also risk creating attack vectors if not used correctly

- **Deterministic by design** - the design of a relayer should ensure a single, deterministic way to process messages in your protocol. Relayers should have a "correct" implementation, mirroring "crank turner" processes used elsewhere in blockchain

## Client-Side Relaying

Client-side relaying relies on user-facing front ends, such as a webpage or a wallet, to complete the cross-chain process.

### Key Features

- **Cost-efficiency** - users only pay the transaction fee for the second transaction, eliminating any additional costs

- **No backend infrastructure** - the process is wholly client-based, eliminating the need for a backend relaying infrastructure

### Implementation

Users themselves carry out the three steps of the cross-chain process:

1. Perform an action on chain A

2. Retrieve the resulting VAA from the Guardian Network

3. Perform an action on chain B using the VAA

### Considerations

Though simple, this type of relaying is generally not recommended if your aim is a highly polished user experience. It can, however, be useful for getting a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) up and running.

- Users must sign all required transactions with their own wallet

- Users must have funds to pay the transaction fees on every chain involved

- The user experience may be cumbersome due to the manual steps involved

## Custom Relayers

Custom relayers are purpose-built components within the Wormhole protocol, designed to relay messages for specific applications. They can perform off-chain computations and can be customized to suit a variety of use cases.

The main method of setting up a custom relayer is by listening directly to the Guardian Network via a [Spy](/docs/learn/infrastructure/spy/).

### Key Features

- **Optimization** - capable of performing trustless off-chain computations which can optimize gas costs

- **Customizability** - allows for specific strategies like batching, conditional delivery, multi-chain deliveries, and more

- **Incentive structure** - developers have the freedom to design an incentive structure suitable for their application

- **Enhanced UX** - the ability to retrieve a VAA from the Guardian Network and perform an action on the target chain using the VAA on behalf of the user can simplify the user experience

### Implementation

A plugin relayer to make the development of custom relayers easier is available in the [main Wormhole repository](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/main/relayer){target=\_blank}. This plugin sets up the basic infrastructure for relaying, allowing developers to focus on implementing the specific logic for their application.

### Considerations

Remember, despite their name, custom relayers still need to be considered trustless. VAAs are public and can be submitted by anyone, so developers shouldn't rely on off-chain relayers to perform any computation considered "trusted."

- Development work and hosting of relayers are required

- The fee-modeling can become complex, as relayers are responsible for paying target chain fees

- Relayers are responsible for availability, and adding dependencies for the cross-chain application

## Wormhole Relayers

Wormhole relayers are a component of a decentralized network in the Wormhole protocol. They facilitate the delivery of VAAs to recipient contracts compatible with the standard relayer API.

### Key Features

- **Lower operational costs** - no need to develop, host, or maintain individual relayers

- **Simplified integration** - because there is no need to run a relayer, integration is as simple as calling a function and implementing an interface

### Implementation

The Wormhole relayer integration involves two key steps:

- **Delivery request** - request delivery from the ecosystem Wormhole relayer contract

- **Relay reception** - implement a [`receiveWormholeMessages`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk/blob/bacbe82e6ae3f7f5ec7cdcd7d480f1e528471bbb/src/interfaces/IWormholeReceiver.sol#L44-L50){target=\_blank} function within their contracts. This function is invoked upon successful relay of the VAA

### Considerations

Developers should note that the choice of relayers depends on their project's specific requirements and constraints. Wormhole relayers offer simplicity and convenience but limit customization and optimization opportunities compared to custom relayers.

- All computations are performed on-chain

- Potentially less gas-efficient compared to custom relayers

- Optimization features like conditional delivery, batching, and off-chain calculations might be restricted

- Support may not be available for all chains

# Spy

## Introduction

In Wormhole’s ecosystem, the _Spy_ is a daemon, a continuously running background process that monitors messages within the Guardian Network. Unlike Guardians, Spies don’t perform validation; instead, they serve as an interface for observing the network’s message traffic, enabling applications and users to access live data transmitted over Wormhole.

The primary purpose of a Spy is to subscribe to the gossiped messages across the Guardian Network, tracking key message types that allow integrators and applications to monitor real-time network activity without directly engaging in consensus operations.

## Key Features of the Spy

### Monitor Spy-Accessible Messages

Spies can access the following categories of messages shared over the gossip protocol::

- [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} - packets of cross-chain data. The Spy can detect whether a VAA has been approved by the Guardian Network, making it a valuable tool for applications needing real-time cross-chain verification
- [Observations](/docs/learn/glossary/#observation){target=\_blank} - emitted by Wormhole’s core contracts, observations are picked up by the Guardians and relayed across the network. Spies allow users to monitor these messages, adding transparency and insight into blockchain events
- [Guardian heartbeats](/docs/learn/glossary/#heartbeat){target=\_blank} - heartbeat messages represent Guardian node statusn. By monitoring heartbeats, a Spy can signal the liveness and connectivity of Guardians in the network

## Integrator Use Case

The Spy provides a valuable mechanism for integrators to observe real-time network activity in the Guardian Network without directly engaging in validation or consensus. By running a Spy, integrators can track cross-chain events, and message flows — such as VAAs, observations, and Guardian heartbeats — to monitor network activity essential to their applications.

This monitoring capability is especially beneficial for applications that need immediate insights into cross-chain data events. Integrators can run a Spy to ensure their applications are promptly informed of message approvals, observations, or Guardian liveness signals, supporting timely and responsive app behavior without additional overhead on network resources.

## Resources

For more information, you can check out the following resources:

- The source code for the Go implementation of the Spy is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/node/cmd/spy/spy.go){target=\_blank}
- To find out how to [start and run a Spy](/docs/infrastructure/spy/run-spy/){target=\_blank}, refer to the infrastructure section. This setup enables integrators to create a custom endpoint that applications can use to observe message flows in the Guardian Network, providing greater flexibility and control over cross-chain monitoring

# Verified Action Approvals

Verified Action Approvals (VAAs) are Wormhole's core messaging primitive. They are packets of cross-chain data emitted whenever a cross-chain application contract interacts with the Core Contract.

[Guardians](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} validate messages emitted by contracts before sending them to the target chain. Once a majority of Guardians agree the message is valid, they sign a keccak256 hash of the message body. 

The message is wrapped up in a structure called a VAA, which combines the message with the Guardian signatures to form a proof. 

VAAs are uniquely indexed by the (`emitter_chain`, `emitter_address`, `sequence`) tuple. To obtain a VAA, one can query the [Wormholescan API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank} with this information.

The `sequence` field depends on the final ordering of blocks on the emitter chain. When a lower consistency level is chosen (i.e., not waiting for finality), there is a chance that chain reorganizations could lead to multiple, different VAAs appearing for what looks like the “same” message on the user side. 
    
The tuple (`emitter_chain`, `emitter_address`, `sequence`) can only be considered unique if the chain does not undergo a reorg and the block containing the message has effectively reached finality. However, there is always a small chance of an extended reorg that could invalidate or alter a previously emitted sequence number.

## VAA Format

The basic VAA consists of header and body components described as follows:

- **Header** - holds metadata about the current VAA, the Guardian set that is currently active, and the list of signatures gathered so far
    - `version` ++"byte"++ - the VAA Version
    - `guardian_set_index` ++"u32"++ - indicates which Guardian set is signing
    - `len_signatures` ++"u8"++ - the number of signatures stored
    - `signatures` ++"[]signature"++ - the collection of Guardian signatures

    Where each `signature` is:

    - `index` ++"u8"++ - the index of this Guardian in the Guardian set
    - `signature` ++"[65]byte"++ - the ECDSA signature

- **Body** - _deterministically_ derived from an on-chain message. Any two Guardians processing the same message must derive the same resulting body to maintain a one-to-one relationship between VAAs and messages to avoid double-processing messages
    - `timestamp` ++"u32"++ - the timestamp of the block this message was published in
    - `nonce` ++"u32"++
    - `emitter_chain` ++"u16"++ - the id of the chain that emitted the message
    - `emitter_address` ++"[32]byte"++ - the contract address (Wormhole formatted) that called the Core Contract
    - `sequence` ++"u64"++ - the auto-incrementing integer that represents the number of messages published by this emitter
    - `consistency_level` ++"u8"++ - the consistency level (finality) required by this emitter
    - `payload` ++"[]byte"++ - arbitrary bytes containing the data to be acted on

The deterministic nature of the body is only strictly true once the chain's state is finalized. If a reorg occurs, and a transaction that previously appeared in block X is replaced by block Y, Guardians observing different forks may generate different VAAs for what the emitter contract believes is the same message. This scenario is less likely once a block is sufficiently buried, but it can still happen if you choose a faster (less finalized) consistency level

The body contains relevant information for entities, such as contracts or other systems, that process or utilize VAAs. When a function like `parseAndVerifyVAA` is called, the body is returned, allowing verification of the `emitterAddress` to determine if the VAA originated from a trusted contract.

Because VAAs have no destination, they are effectively multicast. Any Core Contract on any chain in the network will verify VAAs as authentic. If a VAA has a specific destination, relayers are responsible for appropriately completing that delivery.

## Consistency and Finality

The consistency level determines whether Guardians wait for a chain's final commitment state or issue a VAA sooner under less-final conditions. This choice is especially relevant for blockchains without instant finality, where the risk of reorganization remains until a block is deeply confirmed. 

Guardian watchers are specialized processes that monitor each blockchain in real-time. They enforce the selected consistency level by deciding whether enough commitment has been reached before signing and emitting a VAA. Some chains allow only one commitment level (effectively final), while others let integrators pick between near-final or fully finalized states. Choosing a faster option speeds up VAA production but increases reorg risk. A more conservative option takes longer but reduces the likelihood of rollback.

## Signatures

The body of the VAA is hashed twice with `keccak256` to produce the signed digest message.

```js
// hash the bytes of the body twice
digest = keccak256(keccak256(body))
// sign the result 
signature = ecdsa_sign(digest, key)
```

!!!tip "Hash vs. double hash"
    Different implementations of the ECDSA signature validation may apply a keccak256 hash to the message passed, so care must be taken to pass the correct arguments.
    
    For example, the [Solana secp256k1 program](https://docs.solanalabs.com/runtime/programs#secp256k1-program){target=\_blank} will hash the message passed. In this case, the argument for the message should be a single hash of the body, not the twice-hashed body.

## Payload Types

Different applications built on Wormhole may specify a format for the payloads attached to a VAA. This payload provides information on the target chain and contract so it can take action (e.g., minting tokens to a receiver address).

### Token Transfer

Many bridges use a lockup/mint and burn/unlock mechanism to transfer tokens between chains. Wormhole's generic message-passing protocol handles the routing of lock and burn events across chains to ensure Wormhole's Token Bridge is chain-agnostic and can be rapidly integrated into any network with a Wormhole contract.

Transferring tokens from the sending chain to the destination chain requires the following steps:

1. Lock the token on the sending chain
2. The sending chain emits a message as proof the token lockup is complete
3. The destination chain receives the message confirming the lockup event on the sending chain
4. The token is minted on the destination chain

The message the sending chain emits to verify the lockup is referred to as a transfer message and has the following structure:

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ - the ID of the payload. This should be set to `1` for a token transfer
- `amount` ++"u256"++ - amount of tokens being transferred
- `token_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the source chain
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the source chain
- `to` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the destination chain
- `to_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the destination chain
- `fee` ++"u256"++ - portion of amount paid to a relayer

This structure contains everything the destination chain needs to learn about a lockup event. Once the destination chain receives this payload, it can mint the corresponding asset.

Note that the destination chain is agnostic regarding how the tokens on the sending side were locked. They could have been burned by a mint or locked in a custody account. The protocol relays the event once enough Guardians have attested to its existence.

### Attestation

While the destination chain can trust the message from the sending chain to inform it of token lockup events, it has no way of verifying the correct token is locked up. To solve this, the Token Bridge supports token attestation.

To create a token attestation, the sending chain emits a message containing metadata about a token, which the destination chain may use to preserve the name, symbol, and decimal precision of a token address.

The message format for token attestation is as follows:

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ - the ID of the payload. This should be set to `2` for an attestation
- `token_address` ++"[32]byte"++ - address of the originating token contract
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - chain ID of the originating token 
- `decimals` ++"u8"++ - number of decimals this token should have
- `symbol` ++"[32]byte"++ - short name of asset
- `name` ++"[32]byte"++ - full name of asset

#### Attestation Tips 

Be aware of the following considerations when working with attestations:

- Attestations use a fixed-length byte array to encode UTF8 token name and symbol data. Because the byte array is fixed length, the data contained may truncate multibyte Unicode characters

- When sending an attestation VAA, it is recommended to send the longest UTF8 prefix that doesn't truncate a character and then right-pad it with zero bytes

- When parsing an attestation VAA, it is recommended to trim all trailing zero bytes and convert the remainder to UTF-8 via any lossy algorithm

- Be mindful that different on-chain systems may have different VAA parsers, resulting in different names/symbols on different chains if the string is long or contains invalid UTF8

- Without knowing a token's decimal precision, the destination chain cannot correctly mint the number of tokens when processing a transfer. For this reason, the Token Bridge requires an attestation for each token transfer

### Token Transfer with Message

The Token Transfer with Message data structure is identical to the token-only data structure, except for the following:

- **`fee` field** - replaced with the `from_address` field 
- **`payload` field** - is added containing arbitrary bytes. A dApp may include additional data in this arbitrary byte field to inform some application-specific behavior

This VAA type was previously known as Contract Controlled Transfer and is also sometimes referred to as a `payload3` message. The Token Transfer with Message data sructure is as follows:

- `payload_id` ++"u8"++ -  the ID of the payload. This should be set to `3` for a token transfer with message 
- `amount` ++"u256"++ - amount of tokens being transferred
- `token_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the source chain
- `token_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the source chain
- `to` ++"u8[32]"++ - address on the destination chain
- `to_chain` ++"u16"++ - numeric ID for the destination chain
- `from_address` ++"u8[32]"++ - address that called the Token Bridge on the source chain
- `payload` ++"[]byte"++ - message, arbitrary bytes, app-specific

### Governance

Governance VAAs don't have a `payload_id` field like the preceding formats. Instead, they trigger an action in the deployed contracts (for example, an upgrade).

#### Action Structure

Governance messages contain pre-defined actions, which can target the various Wormhole modules currently deployed on-chain. The structure includes the following fields:

- `module` ++"u8[32]"++ - contains a right-aligned module identifier
- `action` ++"u8"++ - predefined governance action to execute
- `chain`  ++"u16"++ - chain the action is targeting. This should be set to `0` for all chains
- `args`  ++"any"++ - arguments to the action

Below is an example message containing a governance action triggering a code upgrade to the Solana Core Contract. The module field here is a right-aligned encoding of the ASCII Core, represented as a 32-byte hex string.

```js
module:       0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000436f7265
action:       1
chain:        1
new_contract: 0x348567293758957162374959376192374884562522281937446234828323
```

#### Actions

The meaning of each numeric action is pre-defined and documented in the Wormhole design documents. For each application, the relevant definitions can be found via these links:

- [Core governance actions](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0002_governance_messaging.md){target=\_blank}
- [Token Bridge governance actions](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0003_token_bridge.md){target=\_blank}

## Lifetime of a Message

Anyone can submit a VAA to the target chain. Guardians typically don't perform this step to avoid transaction fees. Instead, applications built on top of Wormhole can acquire a VAA via the Guardian RPC and submit it in a separate flow.

With the concepts now defined, it is possible to illustrate a full flow for message passing between two chains. The following stages demonstrate each step of processing that the Wormhole network performs to route a message.

1. **A message is emitted by a contract running on Chain A** - any contract can emit messages, and the Guardians are programmed to observe all chains for these events. Here, the Guardians are represented as a single entity to simplify the graphics, but the observation of the message must be performed individually by each of the 19 Guardians
2. **Signatures are aggregated** - Guardians independently observe and sign the message. Once enough Guardians have signed the message, the collection of signatures is combined with the message and metadata to produce a VAA
3. **VAA submitted to target chain** - the VAA acts as proof that the Guardians have collectively attested the existence of the message payload. The VAA is submitted (or relayed) to the target chain to be processed by a receiving contract and complete the final step

# Introduction to Wormhole

In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, interoperability between different blockchains remains a significant challenge. Developers often face hurdles in creating applications that can seamlessly operate across multiple blockchains, limiting innovation and the potential of decentralized ecosystems.

Wormhole addresses this problem by providing a _generic message-passing_ protocol that enables secure and efficient communication between blockchains. By allowing data and asset transfers across various blockchain networks, Wormhole breaks down the walls that traditionally separate these ecosystems.

Wormhole is distinguished by its focus on robust security, scalability, and transparency. The protocol is supported by a decentralized network of validators that ensure the integrity of every cross-chain transaction. This, combined with Wormhole’s proven performance in real-world applications, gives developers a dependable platform to create and scale multichain applications confidently.

    The above is an oversimplified illustration of the protocol; details about the architecture and components are available on the [architecture page](/docs/learn/infrastructure/architecture/){target=\_blank}.

Wormhole allows developers to leverage the strengths of multiple blockchain ecosystems without being confined to one. This means applications can benefit from the unique features of various networks—such as Solana's high throughput, Ethereum's security, and Cosmos's interoperability while maintaining a unified, efficient user experience.

This page introduces the key concepts and components necessary to understand how Wormhole enables fast, secure, and scalable cross-chain communication.

## What Problems Does Wormhole Solve?

Interoperability is a critical challenge in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Individual blockchains are often isolated, limiting the potential for integrated applications operating across multiple ecosystems. Wormhole solves this problem by enabling seamless communication between blockchains, allowing developers to create multichain applications that can leverage the unique features of each network.

Critical problems Wormhole addresses include:

- **Blockchain isolation** - Wormhole connects disparate blockchains, enabling the transfer of assets, data, and governance actions across networks
- **Cross-chain complexity** - by abstracting the complexities of cross-chain communication, Wormhole makes it easier for developers to build and deploy cross-chain applications
- **Security and decentralization** - Wormhole prioritizes security through a decentralized Guardian network that validates and signs messages, ensuring the integrity of cross-chain interactions

## What Does Wormhole Offer?

Wormhole provides a suite of tools and protocols that support a wide range of use cases:

- **Cross-chain messaging** - securely transfer arbitrary data between blockchains, enabling the development of cross-chain decentralized applications (xDapps)
- **Asset transfers** - facilitate the movement of tokens and NFTs across supported chains with ease, powered by protocols built on Wormhole like [Portal](https://portalbridge.com/){target=\_blank}
- **Developer tools** - leverage [Wormhole’s SDKs](/docs/build/toolkit/typescript-sdk/){target=\_blank}, [APIs](/docs/build/toolkit/#wormhole-api-docs){target=\_blank}, [Wormhole Scan](https://wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}, and documentation to build and deploy cross-chain applications quickly and efficiently

## What Isn't Wormhole?

- **Wormhole is _not_ a blockchain** - it acts as a communication layer that connects different blockchains, enabling them to interact without being a blockchain itself
- **Wormhole is _not_ a token bridge** - while it facilitates token transfers, Wormhole also supports a wide range of cross-chain applications, making it much more versatile than a typical bridge

## Use Cases of Wormhole

Consider the following examples of potential applications enabled by Wormhole:

- **Cross-chain exchange** - using [Wormhole Connect](/docs/build/transfers/connect/overview/){target=\_blank}, developers can build exchanges that allow deposits from any Wormhole-connected chain, significantly increasing liquidity access
- **[Cross-chain governance](https://wormhole.com/blog/stake-for-governance-is-now-live-for-w-token-holders){target=\_blank}** - NFT collections on different networks can use Wormhole to communicate votes cast on their respective chains to a designated "voting" chain for combined proposals
- **Cross-chain game** - games can be developed on a performant network like Solana, with rewards issued as NFTs on another network, such as Ethereum

# Security

## Core Security Assumptions

At its core, Wormhole is secured by a network of [Guardian](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} nodes that validate and sign messages. If a super majority (e.g., 13 out of 19) of Guardians sign the same message, it can be considered valid. A smart contract on the target chain will verify the signatures and format of the message before approving any transaction.

- Wormhole's core security primitive is its signed messages (signed [VAAs](/docs/learn/glossary/#vaa){target=\_blank})
- The Guardian network is currently secured by a collection of 19 of the world's top [validator companies](https://wormhole-foundation.github.io/wormhole-dashboard/#/?endpoint=Mainnet){target=\_blank}
- Guardians produce signed state attestations (signed VAAs) when requested by a Core Contract integrator
- Every Guardian runs full nodes (rather than light nodes) of every blockchain in the Wormhole network, so if a blockchain suffers a consensus attack or hard fork, the blockchain will disconnect from the network rather than potentially produce invalid signed VAAs
- Any Signed VAA can be verified as authentic by the Core Contract of any other chain
- [Relayers](/docs/learn/glossary/#relayer){target=\_blank} are considered untrusted in the Wormhole ecosystem

In summary:

- **Core integrators aren't exposed to risk from chains and contracts they don't integrate with**
- By default, you only trust Wormhole's signing process and the core contracts of the chains you're on
- You can expand your contract and chain dependencies as you see fit

Core assumptions aside, many other factors impact the real-world security of decentralized platforms. Here is more information on additional measures that have been put in place to ensure the security of Wormhole.

## Guardian Network

Wormhole is an evolving platform. While the Guardian set currently comprises 19 validators, this is a limitation of current blockchain technology.

### Governance

Governance is the process through which contract upgrades happen. Guardians manually vote on governance proposals that originate inside the Guardian Network and are then submitted to ecosystem contracts.

This means that governance actions are held to the same security standard as the rest of the system. A two-thirds supermajority of the Guardians is required to pass any governance action.

Governance messages can target any of the various wormhole modules, including the core contracts and all currently deployed token bridge contracts. When a Guardian signs such a message, its signature implies a vote on the action in question. Once more than two-thirds of the Guardians have signed, the message and governance action are considered valid.

All governance actions and contract upgrades have been managed via Wormhole's on-chain governance system.

Via governance, the Guardians can:

- Change the current Guardian set
- Expand the Guardian set
- Upgrade ecosystem contract implementations

The governance system is fully open source in the core repository. See the [Open Source section](#open-source){target=\_blank} for contract source.

## Monitoring

A key element of Wormhole's defense-in-depth strategy is that each Guardian is a highly competent validator company with its own in-house processes for running, monitoring, and securing blockchain operations. This heterogeneous approach to monitoring increases the likelihood that fraudulent activity is detected and reduces the number of single failure points in the system.

Guardians are not just running Wormhole validators; they're running validators for every blockchain inside of Wormhole as well, which allows them to perform monitoring holistically across decentralized computing rather than just at a few single points.

Guardians monitor:

- Block production and consensus of each blockchain - if a blockchain's consensus is violated, it will be disconnected from the network until the Guardians resolve the issue
- Smart contract level data - via processes like the Governor, Guardians constantly monitor the circulating supply and token movements across all supported blockchains
- Guardian level activity - the Guardian Network functions as an autonomous decentralized computing network, ensuring independent security measures across its validators

## Asset Layer Protections

One key strength of the Wormhole ecosystem is the Guardians’ ability to validate and protect the integrity of assets across multiple blockchains.

To enforce the Wormhole Asset Layer’s core protections, the Global Accountant tracks the total circulating supply of all Wormhole assets across all chains, preventing any blockchain from bridging assets that could violate the supply invariant.

In addition to the Global Accountant, Guardians may only sign transfers that do not violate the requirements of the Governor. The [Governor](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/whitepapers/0007_governor.md){target=\_blank} tracks inflows and outflows of all blockchains and delays suspicious transfers that may indicate an exploit.

# Get Started with Core Contracts

## Introduction

Wormhole's Core Contracts, deployed on each supported blockchain network, enable the fundamental operations of sending and receiving cross-chain messages.

While the implementation details of the Core Contracts varies by network, the core functionality remains consistent across chains. Each version of the Core Contract facilitates secure and reliable cross-chain communication, ensuring that developers can effectively publish and verify messages.

This guide will walk you through the variations and key methods of the Core Contracts, providing you with the knowledge needed to integrate them into your cross-chain contracts. To learn more about Core Contracts' features and how it works, please refer to the [Core Contracts](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank} page in the Learn section.

## Prerequisites

To interact with the Wormhole Core Contract, you'll need the following:

- The [address of the Core Contract](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#core-contracts){target=\_blank} on the chains you're deploying your contract on
- The [Wormhole chain ID](/docs/build/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank} of the chains you're deploying your contract on
- The [Wormhole Finality](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} (consistency) levels (required finality) for the chains you're deploying your contract on

## How to Interact with Core Contracts

Before writing your own contracts, it's essential to understand the key functions and events of the Wormhole Core Contracts. The primary functionality revolves around:

- **Sending messages** - submitting messages to the Wormhole network for cross-chain communication
- **Receiving and verifying messages** - validating messages received from other chains via the Wormhole network

While the implementation details of the Core Contracts vary by network, the core functionality remains consistent across chains.

### Sending Messages

To send a message, regardless of the environment or chain, the Core Contract is invoked with a message argument from an [emitter](/docs/learn/glossary/#emitter){target=\_blank}. This emitter might be your contract or an existing application such as the [Token Bridge](/docs/learn/transfers/token-bridge/#token-bridge){target=\_blank}.

=== "EVM"

    The `IWormhole.sol` interface provides the `publishMessage` function, which can be used to publish a message directly to the Core Contract:

    ```solidity
    function publishMessage(
    uint32 nonce,
    bytes memory payload,
    uint8 consistencyLevel
) external payable returns (uint64 sequence);
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `nonce` ++"uint32"++
        
        A free integer field that can be used however you like. Note that changing the `nonce` will result in a different digest.

        ---

        `payload` ++"bytes memory"++
        
        The content of the emitted message. Due to the constraints of individual blockchains, it may be capped to a certain maximum length.

        ---

        `consistencyLevel` ++"uint8"++
        
        A value that defines the required level of finality that must be reached before the Guardians will observe and attest to emitted events.

    ??? interface "Returns"

        `sequence` ++"uint64"++
        
        A unique number that increments for every message for a given emitter (and implicitly chain). This, combined with the emitter address and emitter chain ID, allows the VAA for this message to be queried from the [Wormholescan API](https://docs.wormholescan.io/){target=\_blank}.
    
    ??? interface "Example"

        ```solidity
        IWormhole wormhole = IWormhole(wormholeAddr);

// Get the fee for publishing a message
uint256 wormholeFee = wormhole.messageFee();

// Check fee and send parameters

// Create the HelloWorldMessage struct
HelloWorldMessage memory parsedMessage = HelloWorldMessage({
    payloadID: uint8(1),
    message: helloWorldMessage
});

// Encode the HelloWorldMessage struct into bytes
bytes memory encodedMessage = encodeMessage(parsedMessage);

// Send the HelloWorld message by calling publishMessage on the
// wormhole core contract and paying the Wormhole protocol fee.
messageSequence = wormhole.publishMessage{value: wormholeFee}(
    0, // batchID
    encodedMessage,
    wormholeFinality()
);
        ```

=== "Solana"

    The `wormhole_anchor_sdk::wormhole` module and the Wormhole program account can be used to pass a message directly to the Core Contract via the `wormhole::post_message` function:

    ```rs
    pub fn post_message<'info>(
        ctx: CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, PostMessage<'info>>,
        batch_id: u32,
        payload: Vec<u8>,
        finality: Finality
    ) -> Result<()>
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `ctx` ++"CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, PostMessage<'info>>"++ 
        
        Provides the necessary context for executing the function, including the accounts and program information required for the Cross-Program Invocation (CPI).

        ??? child "Type `pub struct CpiContext<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T>`"

            ```rs
            pub struct CpiContext<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T>
            where
                T: ToAccountMetas + ToAccountInfos<'info>,
            {
                pub accounts: T,
                pub remaining_accounts: Vec<AccountInfo<'info>>,
                pub program: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub signer_seeds: &'a [&'b [&'c [u8]]],
            }
            ```

            For more information, please refer to the [`wormhole_anchor_sdk` Rust docs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/0.29.0/anchor_lang/context/struct.CpiContext.html){target=\_blank}.

        ??? child "Type `PostMessage<'info>`"

            ```rs
            pub struct PostMessage<'info> {
                pub config: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub message: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub emitter: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub sequence: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub payer: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub fee_collector: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub clock: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub rent: AccountInfo<'info>,
                pub system_program: AccountInfo<'info>,
            }
            ```

            For more information, please refer to the [`wormhole_anchor_sdk` Rust docs](https://docs.rs/wormhole-anchor-sdk/latest/wormhole_anchor_sdk/wormhole/instructions/struct.PostMessage.html){target=\_blank}.

        ---

        `batch_id` ++"u32"++
        
        An identifier for the message batch.

        ---

        `payload` ++"Vec<u8>"++
        
        The data being sent in the message. This is a variable-length byte array that contains the actual content or information being transmitted. To learn about the different types of payloads, check out the [VAAs](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas#payload-types){target=\_blank} page.

        ---

        `finality` ++"Finality"++
        
        Specifies the level of finality or confirmation required for the message.
        
        ??? child "Type `Finality`"

            ```rs
            pub enum Finality {
                Confirmed,
                Finalized,
            }
            ```
    
    ??? interface "Returns"

        ++"Result<()>"++
        
        The result of the function’s execution. If the function completes successfully, it returns `Ok(())`, otherwise it returns `Err(E)`, indicating that an error occurred along with the details about the error
    
    ??? interface "Example"

        ```rust
        let fee = ctx.accounts.wormhole_bridge.fee();
// ... Check fee and send parameters

let config = &ctx.accounts.config;
let payload: Vec<u8> = HelloWorldMessage::Hello { message }.try_to_vec()?;

// Invoke `wormhole::post_message`.
wormhole::post_message(
    CpiContext::new_with_signer(
        ctx.accounts.wormhole_program.to_account_info(),
        wormhole::PostMessage {
            // ... Set fields
        },
        &[
            // ... Set seeds
        ],
    ),
    config.batch_id,
    payload,
    config.finality.into(),
)?;
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/solana/programs/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

Once the message is emitted from the Core Contract, the [Guardian Network](/docs/learn/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank} will observe the message and sign the digest of an Attestation [VAA](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}. On EVM chains, the body of the VAA is hashed twice with keccak256 to produce the signed digest message. On Solana, the [Solana secp256k1 program](https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs#secp256k1-program){target=\_blank} will hash the message passed. In this case, the argument for the message should be a single hash of the body, not the twice-hashed body.

VAAs are [multicast](/docs/learn/infrastructure/core-contracts/#multicast){target=\_blank} by default. This means there is no default target chain for a given message. The application developer decides on the format of the message and its treatment upon receipt.

### Receiving Messages

The way a message is received and handled depends on the environment.

=== "EVM"

    On EVM chains, the message passed is the raw VAA encoded as binary. The `IWormhole.sol` interface provides the `parseAndVerifyVM` function, which can be used to parse and verify the received message.

    ```solidity
    function parseAndVerifyVM(
    bytes calldata encodedVM
) external view returns (VM memory vm, bool valid, string memory reason);
    ```

    ??? interface "Parameters"

        `encodedVM` ++"bytes calldata"++
        
        The encoded message as a Verified Action Approval (VAA), which contains all necessary information for verification and processing.

    ??? interface "Returns"

        `vm` ++"VM memory"++
        
        The valid parsed VAA, which will include the original `emitterAddress`, `sequenceNumber`, and `consistencyLevel`, among other fields outlined on the [VAAs](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/) page.

        ??? child "Struct `VM`"

            ```solidity
            struct VM {
                uint8 version;
                uint32 timestamp;
                uint32 nonce;
                uint16 emitterChainId;
                bytes32 emitterAddress;
                uint64 sequence;
                uint8 consistencyLevel;
                bytes payload;
                uint32 guardianSetIndex;
                Signature[] signatures;
                bytes32 hash;
            }
            ```

            For more information, refer to the [`IWormhole.sol` interface](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/IWormhole.sol){target=\_blank}.

        ---
        
        `valid` ++"bool"++
        
        A boolean indicating whether the VAA is valid or not.
        
        ---

        `reason` ++"string"++
        
        If the VAA is not valid, a reason will be provided

    ??? interface "Example"

        ```solidity
        function receiveMessage(bytes memory encodedMessage) public {
    // Call the Wormhole core contract to parse and verify the encodedMessage
    (
        IWormhole.VM memory wormholeMessage,
        bool valid,
        string memory reason
    ) = wormhole().parseAndVerifyVM(encodedMessage);

    // Perform safety checks here

    // Decode the message payload into the HelloWorldMessage struct
    HelloWorldMessage memory parsedMessage = decodeMessage(
        wormholeMessage.payload
    );

    // Your custom application logic here
}
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/evm/src/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

=== "Solana"

    On Solana, the VAA is first posted and verified by the Core Contract, after which it can be read by the receiving contract and action taken.

    Retrieve the raw message data:

    ```rs
    let posted_message = &ctx.accounts.posted;
    posted_message.data()
    ```

    ??? interface "Example"

        ```rust
        pub fn receive_message(ctx: Context<ReceiveMessage>, vaa_hash: [u8; 32]) -> Result<()> {
    let posted_message = &ctx.accounts.posted;

    if let HelloWorldMessage::Hello { message } = posted_message.data() {
        // Check message
        // Your custom application logic here
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err(HelloWorldError::InvalidMessage.into())
    }
}
        ```

        View the complete Hello World example in the [Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding/tree/main/solana/programs/01_hello_world){target=\_blank} repository on GitHub.

#### Validating the Emitter

When processing cross-chain messages, it's critical to ensure that the message originates from a trusted sender (emitter). This can be done by verifying the emitter address and chain ID in the parsed VAA.

Typically, contracts should provide a method to register trusted emitters and check incoming messages against this list before processing them. For example, the following check ensures that the emitter is registered and authorized:

```solidity
require(isRegisteredSender(emitterChainId, emitterAddress), "Invalid emitter");
```

This check can be applied after the VAA is parsed, ensuring only authorized senders can interact with the receiving contract. Trusted emitters can be registered using a method like `setRegisteredSender` during contract deployment or initialization.

```typescript
const tx = await receiverContract.setRegisteredSender(
  sourceChain.chainId,
  ethers.zeroPadValue(senderAddress as BytesLike, 32)
);

await tx.wait();
```

#### Additional Checks

In addition to environment-specific checks that should be performed, a contract should take care to check other [fields in the body](/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}, including:

- **Sequence** - is this the expected sequence number? How should out-of-order deliveries be handled?
- **Consistency level** - for the chain this message came from, is the [Wormhole Finality](/docs/build/reference/consistency-levels/){target=\_blank} level enough to guarantee the transaction won't be reverted after taking some action?

The VAA digest is separate from the VAA body but is also relevant. It can be used for replay protection by checking if the digest has already been seen. Since the payload itself is application-specific, there may be other elements to check to ensure safety.

# Wormhole Relayer

## Introduction

The Wormhole-deployed relayers provide a mechanism for contracts on one blockchain to send messages to contracts on another without requiring off-chain infrastructure. Through the Wormhole relayer module, developers can use an untrusted delivery provider to transport VAAs, saving the need to build and maintain custom relaying solutions. The option to [run a custom relayer](/docs/infrastructure/relayers/run-relayer/) is available for more complex needs.

This section covers the components and interfaces involved in using the Wormhole relayer module, such as message sending and receiving, delivery guarantees, and considerations for building reliable and efficient cross-chain applications. Additionally, you'll find details on how to handle specific implementation scenarios and track message delivery progress using the Wormhole CLI tool.

## Get Started with the Wormhole Relayer

Before getting started, it's important to note that the Wormhole-deployed relayer configuration is currently **limited to EVM environments**. The complete list of EVM environment blockchains is on the [Supported Networks](/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/) page.

To interact with the Wormhole relayer, you'll need to create contracts on the source and target chains to handle the sending and receiving of messages. No off-chain logic needs to be implemented to take advantage of Wormhole-powered relaying.

  <figcaption>The components outlined in blue must be implemented.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Wormhole Relayer Interfaces

There are three relevant interfaces to discuss when utilizing the Wormhole relayer module:

- [**`IWormholeRelayer`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IWormholeRelayer.sol){target=\_blank} - the primary interface by which you send and receive messages. It allows you to request the sending of messages and VAAs
- [**`IWormholeReceiver`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IWormholeReceiver.sol){target=\_blank} - this is the interface you are responsible for implementing. It allows the selected delivery provider to deliver messages/VAAs to your contract
- [**`IDeliveryProvider`**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/interfaces/relayer/IDeliveryProvider.sol){target=\_blank} - this interface represents the delivery pricing information for a given relayer network. Each delivery provider implements this on every blockchain they support delivering from

## Interact with the Wormhole Relayer

To start interacting with the Wormhole relayer in your contracts, you'll need to import the `IWormholeRelayer` interface and set up a reference using the contract address to the Wormhole-deployed relayer on the supported network of your choice.

To easily integrate with the Wormhole relayer interface, you can use the [Wormhole Solidity SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-solidity-sdk){target=\_blank}.

To retrieve the contract address of the Wormhole relayer, refer to the Wormhole relayer section on the [Contract Addresses](/docs/build/reference/contract-addresses/#wormhole-relayer) reference page.

Your initial set up should resemble the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "wormhole-solidity-sdk/interfaces/IWormholeRelayer.sol";

contract Example {
    IWormholeRelayer public wormholeRelayer;

    constructor(address _wormholeRelayer) {
        wormholeRelayer = IWormholeRelayer(_wormholeRelayer);
    }
}
```

The code provided sets up the basic structure for your contract to interact with the Wormhole relayer using the address supplied to the constructor. By leveraging methods from the `IWormholeRelayer` interface, you can implement message sending and receiving functionalities. The following sections will detail the specific methods you need to use for these tasks.

### Send a Message

To send a message to a contract on another EVM chain, you can call the `sendPayloadToEvm` method provided by the `IWormholeRelayer` interface.

```solidity
function sendPayloadToEvm(
    // Chain ID in Wormhole format
    uint16 targetChain,     
    // Contract Address on target chain we're sending a message to
    address targetAddress,  
    // The payload, encoded as bytes
    bytes memory payload,   
    // How much value to attach to the delivery transaction 
    uint256 receiverValue,  
    // The gas limit to set on the delivery transaction
    uint256 gasLimit        
) external payable returns (
    // Unique, incrementing ID, used to identify a message
    uint64 sequence
);
```

!!! tip
    To reduce transaction confirmation time, you can lower the consistency level using the [`sendToEvm`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/v{{repositories.wormhole.version}}/sdk/js/src/relayer/relayer/send.ts#L33){target=\_blank} method.

The `sendPayloadToEvm` method is marked `payable` to receive fee payment for the transaction. The value to attach to the invocation is determined by calling the `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice`, which provides an estimate of the cost of gas on the target chain.

```solidity
function quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
    // Chain ID in Wormhole format
    uint16 targetChain,
    // How much value to attach to delivery transaction 
    uint256 receiverValue,
    // The gas limit to attach to the delivery transaction
    uint256 gasLimit
) external view returns (
    // How much value to attach to the send call
    uint256 nativePriceQuote, 
    uint256 targetChainRefundPerGasUnused
);
```

This method should be called before sending a message, and the value returned for `nativePriceQuote` should be attached to the call to send the payload to cover the transaction's cost on the target chain.

In total, sending a message across EVM chains can be as simple as getting a fee quote and sending the message as follows:

```solidity
// Get a quote for the cost of gas for delivery
(cost, ) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(
    targetChain,
    valueToSend,
    GAS_LIMIT
);

// Send the message
wormholeRelayer.sendPayloadToEvm{value: cost}(
    targetChain,
    targetAddress,
    abi.encode(payload),
    valueToSend, 
    GAS_LIMIT
);
```

### Receive a Message

To receive a message using a Wormhole relayer, the target contract must implement the [`IWormholeReceiver`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-relayer-solidity-sdk/blob/main/src/interfaces/IWormholeReceiver.sol){target=\_blank} interface, as shown in the [previous section](#interact-with-the-wormhole-relayer).

```solidity
function receiveWormholeMessages(
    bytes memory payload,           // Message passed by source contract 
    bytes[] memory additionalVaas,  // Any additional VAAs that are needed (Note: these are unverified) 
    bytes32 sourceAddress,          // The address of the source contract
    uint16 sourceChain,             // The Wormhole chain ID
    bytes32 deliveryHash            // A hash of contents, useful for replay protection
) external payable;
```

The logic inside the function body may be whatever business logic is required to take action on the specific payload.

## Delivery Guarantees

The Wormhole relayer protocol is intended to create a service interface whereby mutually distrustful integrators and delivery providers can work together to provide a seamless dApp experience. You don't trust the delivery providers with your data, and the delivery providers don't trust your smart contract. The primary agreement between integrators and delivery providers is that when a delivery is requested, the provider will attempt to deliver the VAA within the provider's stated delivery timeframe.

This creates a marketplace whereby providers can set different price levels and service guarantees. Delivery providers effectively accept the slippage risk premium of delivering your VAAs in exchange for a set fee rate. Thus, the providers agree to deliver your messages even if they do so at a loss.

Delivery providers should set their prices such that they turn a profit on average but not necessarily on every single transfer. Thus, some providers may choose to set higher rates for tighter guarantees or lower rates for less stringent guarantees.

## Delivery Statuses

All deliveries result in one of the following four outcomes before the delivery provider's delivery timeframe. When they occur, these outcomes are emitted as EVM events from the Wormhole relayer contract. The four possible outcomes are:

- (0) Delivery Success
- (1) Receiver Failure
- (2) Forward Request Success
- (3) Forward Request Failure

A receiver failure is a scenario in which the selected provider attempted the delivery but it could not be completely successfully. The three possible causes for a delivery failure are:

- The target contract does not implement the `IWormholeReceiver` interface
- The target contract threw an exception or reverted during the execution of `receiveWormholeMessages`
- The target contract exceeded the specified `gasLimit` while executing `receiveWormholeMessages`

All three of these scenarios can be avoided with correct design by the integrator, and thus, it is up to the integrator to resolve them. Any other scenario that causes a delivery to not be performed should be considered an outage by some component of the system, including potentially the blockchains themselves.

`Forward Request Success` and `Forward Failure` represent when the delivery succeeded and the user requested a forward during the delivery. If the user has enough funds left over as a refund to complete the forward, the forward will be executed, and the status will be `Forward Request Success`. Otherwise, it will be `Forward Request Failure`.

## Other Considerations

Some implementation details should be considered during development to ensure safety and a pleasant UX. Ensure that your engineering efforts have appropriately considered each of the following areas:

- Receiving a message from a relayer
- Checking for expected emitter
- Calling `parseAndVerify` on any additional VAAs
- Replay protection
- Message ordering (no guarantees on order of messages delivered)
- Forwarding and call chaining
- Refunding overpayment of `gasLimit`
- Refunding overpayment of value sent

## Track the Progress of Messages with the Wormhole CLI

While no off-chain programs are required, a developer may want to track the progress of messages in flight. To track the progress of messages in flight, use the [Wormhole CLI](/docs/build/toolkit/cli/) tool's `status` subcommand. As an example, you can use the following commands to track the status of a transfer by providing the environment, origin network, and transaction hash to the `worm status` command:

=== "Mainnet"

    ```bash
    worm status mainnet ethereum INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH
    ```

=== "Testnet"

    ```bash
    worm status testnet ethereum INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH
    ```

See the [Wormhole CLI tool docs](/docs/build/toolkit/cli/) for installation and usage.

# Wormhole Finality

The following table documents each chain's `consistencyLevel` values (i.e., finality reached before signing). The consistency level defines how long the Guardians should wait before signing a VAA. The finalization time depends on the specific chain's consensus mechanism. The consistency level is a `u8`, so any single byte may be used. However, a small subset has particular meanings. If the `consistencyLevel` isn't one of those specific values, the `Otherwise` column describes how it's interpreted.

!!!note  
    Read-only deployments allow Wormhole messages to be received on chains not fully integrated with Wormhole Guardians. These deployments support cross-chain data verification but cannot originate messages. For example, a governance message can be sent from a fully integrated chain and processed on a read-only chain, but the read-only chain cannot send messages back.

# Wormhole Formatted Addresses

## Introduction

Wormhole formatted addresses are 32-byte hex representations of addresses from any supported blockchain. Whether an address originates from EVM, Solana, Cosmos, or another ecosystem, Wormhole standardizes all addresses into this format to ensure cross-chain compatibility.

This uniform format is essential for smooth interoperability in token transfers and messaging across chains. Wormhole uses formatted addresses throughout the [Wormhole SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts){target=\_blank}, especially in cross-chain transactions, such as transfer functions that utilize the `bytes32` representation for recipient addresses.

## Platform-Specific Address Formats

Each blockchain ecosystem Wormhole supports has its method for formatting native addresses. To enable cross-chain compatibility, Wormhole converts these native addresses into the standardized 32-byte hex format.

Here’s an overview of the native address formats and how they are normalized to the Wormhole format:

| Platform        | Native Address Format            | Wormhole Formatted Address |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| EVM             |  Hex (e.g., 0x...)               |  32-byte Hex               |
| Solana          |  Base58                          |  32-byte Hex               |
| CosmWasm        |  Bech32                          |  32-byte Hex               |
| Algorand        |  Algorand App ID                 |  32-byte Hex               |
| Sui             |  Hex                             |  32-byte Hex               |
| Aptos           |  Hex                             |  32-byte Hex               |
| Near            |  SHA-256                         |  32-byte Hex               |

These conversions allow Wormhole to interact seamlessly with various chains using a uniform format for all addresses.

### Address Format Handling

The Wormhole SDK provides mappings that associate each platform with its native address format. You can find this mapping in the Wormhole SDK file [`platforms.ts`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/007f61b27c650c1cf0fada2436f79940dfa4f211/core/base/src/constants/platforms.ts#L93-L102){target=\_blank}:

```typescript
const platformAddressFormatEntries = [
  ['Evm', 'hex'],
  ['Solana', 'base58'],
  ['Cosmwasm', 'bech32'],
  ['Algorand', 'algorandAppId'],
  ['Sui', 'hex'],
  ['Aptos', 'hex'],
  ['Near', 'sha256'],
];
```

These entries define how the [`UniversalAddress`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/007f61b27c650c1cf0fada2436f79940dfa4f211/core/definitions/src/universalAddress.ts#L23){target=\_blank} class handles different address formats based on the platform.

## Universal Address Methods

The `UniversalAddress` class is essential for working with Wormhole formatted addresses. It converts native blockchain addresses into the standardized 32-byte hex format used across Wormhole operations.

Key functions:

 - **`new UniversalAddress()`** - use the `UniversalAddress` constructor to convert native addresses into the Wormhole format

    ```typescript
    const universalAddress = new UniversalAddress('0x123...', 'hex');
    ```

 - **`toUniversalAddress()`** - converts a platform-specific address into the Wormhole formatted 32-byte hex address

    ```typescript
    const ethAddress: NativeAddress<'Evm'> = toNative('Ethereum', '0x0C9...');
    const universalAddress = ethAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
    ```

 - **`toNative()`** - converts the Wormhole formatted address back to a native address for a specific blockchain platform

    ```typescript
    const nativeAddress = universalAddress.toNative('Evm');
    ```

 - **`toString()`** - returns the Wormhole formatted address as a hex string, which can be used in various SDK operations

    ```typescript
    console.log(universalAddress.toString());
    ```

These methods allow developers to convert between native addresses and the Wormhole format, ensuring cross-chain compatibility.

## Convert Between Native and Wormhole Formatted Addresses

The Wormhole SDK allows developers to easily convert between native addresses and Wormhole formatted addresses when building cross-chain applications.

### Convert a Native Address to a Wormhole Formatted Address

Example conversions for EVM and Solana:

=== "EVM"

    ```typescript
    import { toNative } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core';

const ethAddress: NativeAddress<'Evm'> = toNative(
  'Ethereum',
  '0x0C99567DC6f8f1864cafb580797b4B56944EEd28'
);
const universalAddress = ethAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
console.log('Universal Address (EVM):', universalAddress);
    ```

=== "Solana"

    ```typescript
    import { toNative } from '@wormhole-foundation/sdk-core';

const solAddress: NativeAddress<'Solana'> = toNative(
  'Solana',
  '6zZHv9EiqQYcdg52ueADRY6NbCXa37VKPngEHaokZq5J'
);
const universalAddressSol = solAddress.toUniversalAddress().toString();
console.log('Universal Address (Solana):', universalAddressSol);
    ```

The result is a standardized address format that is ready for cross-chain operations.

### Convert Back to Native Addresses

Below is how you can convert a Wormhole formatted address back to an EVM or Solana native address:

```typescript
const nativeAddressEvm = universalAddress.toNative('Evm');
console.log('EVM Native Address:', nativeAddressEvm);

const nativeAddressSolana = universalAddress.toNative('Solana');
console.log('Solana Native Address:', nativeAddressSolana);
```

These conversions ensure that your cross-chain applications can seamlessly handle addresses across different ecosystems.

## Use Cases for Wormhole Formatted Addresses

### Cross-chain Token Transfers

Cross-chain token transfers require addresses to be converted into a standard format. For example, when transferring tokens from Ethereum to Solana, the Ethereum address is converted into a Wormhole formatted address to ensure compatibility. After the transfer, the Wormhole formatted address is converted back into the Solana native format.

### Smart Contract Interactions

In smart contract interactions, especially when building dApps that communicate across multiple chains, Wormhole formatted addresses provide a uniform way to reference addresses. This ensures that addresses from different blockchains can interact seamlessly, whether you're sending messages or making cross-chain contract calls.

### DApp Development

For cross-chain dApp development, Wormhole formatted addresses simplify handling user wallet addresses across various blockchains. This allows developers to manage addresses consistently, regardless of whether they work with EVM, Solana, or another supported platform.

### Relayers and Infrastructure

Finally, relayers and infrastructure components, such as Wormhole Guardians, rely on the standardized format to efficiently process and relay cross-chain messages. A uniform address format simplifies operations, ensuring smooth interoperability across multiple blockchains.
