# Get Started with the TypeScript SDK

## Introduction

The Wormhole TypeScript SDK provides a unified, type-safe interface for building cross-chain applications. It is a foundational toolkit that supports interaction with core Wormhole protocols, including Token Bridge, CCTP, and Settlement, giving developers a consistent API across multiple chains.

This guide helps you install the SDK, initialize a `Wormhole` instance to support your desired network and blockchain platforms, and return chain-specific information to verify successful initialization.

If you want to build more advanced integrations, such as token transfers using the Token Bridge or CCTP Bridge, skip ahead to [Next Steps](#next-steps).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

 - [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm){target=\_blank} installed
 - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/){target=\_blank} installed

??? note "Project setup instructions"
 
    Use the following commands to create a TypeScript project:

    1. Create a directory and initialize a Node.js project:

        ```bash
        mkdir wh-ts-demo
        cd wh-ts-demo
        npm init -y
        ```

    2. Install TypeScript along with `tsx` (for running TypeScript files) and Node.js type definitions:

        ```bash
        npm install --save-dev tsx typescript @types/node
        ```

    3. Create a `tsconfig.json` if you don't have one. You can generate a basic one using the following command:

        ```bash
        npx tsc --init
        ```

        Make sure your `tsconfig.json` includes the following settings:

        ```json 
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                // es2020 or newer
                "target": "es2020",
                // Use esnext if you configured your package.json with type: "module"
                "module": "commonjs",
                "esModuleInterop": true,
                "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
                "strict": true,
                "skipLibCheck": true,
                "resolveJsonModule": true
            }
        }
        ```

## Install the SDK

To install the Wormhole TypeScript SDK, use the following command:

```bash
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk
```

This package combines all the individual packages to make setup easier.

You can choose to install a specific set of packages as needed. For example, to install EVM-specific utilities, you can run:

```bash
npm install @wormhole-foundation/sdk-evm
```

## Initialize the SDK

You must first initialize the main `Wormhole` class to use the SDK. This involves specifying the network (`Mainnet`, `Testnet`, or `Devnet`) and the blockchain platforms your application will interact with.

1. (Optional) Create a new TypeScript file named `src/main.ts` in your project directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir src
    touch src/main.ts
    ```

2. Add the following code to initialize the SDK and use the `Wormhole` instance to return the chain ID and RPC for the chains this instance supports:

    ```ts title="src/main.ts"
    --8<-- "code/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/snippet-1.ts"
    ```

## Fetch Chain Information

Follow these steps to verify that the SDK is properly initialized for the chains you intend to support.

1. Update the `main` function as follows to retrieve the chain ID and RPC for the chains your project supports:

    ```ts title="src/main.ts"
    --8<-- "code/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/snippet-2.ts"
    ```

2. Run the script with the following command, replacing `INSERT_FILE_NAME` with your file name:

    ```bash
    npx tsx INSERT_FILE_NAME
    ```

    You will see terminal output similar to the following:

    --8<-- "code/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/terminal-01.html"
    
Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully installed the Wormhole TypeScript SDK and initialized a `Wormhole` instance. Consider the following options to build on what you've accomplished.
