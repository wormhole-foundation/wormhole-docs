# Messaging Tutorials

## Get Started

Wormhole's cross-chain messaging infrastructure simplifies data transmission, event triggering, and transaction initiation, allowing smart contracts to interact seamlessly across multiple blockchains. The following sections include guides for building your own projects using Wormhole's cross-chain messaging capabilities.
