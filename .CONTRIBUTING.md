## Adding New Pages

It is important to ensure all relevant items are updated correctly when adding new pages to the documenation site in order to prevent broken links and unexpected behavior. This section guides you through the steps to add new documentation pages.

### Creating a Subdirectory

The root directory, and every subdirectory, must contain the following files:

- `.pages` - defines the structure of the documentation site
- `index.md` - represents the landing pages which display the titles of the pages within the directory

#### Example `.pages` File

```markdown
title: Build Apps
nav: 
  - index.md
  - 'Wormhole SDK': 'wormhole-sdk.md'
  - queries
  - connect
```

Assuming this was added under the 'Build' directory, this example would result in adding 'Build Apps' as a subdirectory to 'Build' with two files inside: `index.md` and `wormhole-sdk.md`. 

Some important things to note:

- The `title` field at the top of the page represents the display name for the subdirectory
- The `index.md` page should always be the first item in the `nav` list
- Files follow the convention of 'Display Name': 'file-name.md'
- Subdirectories are listed by their directory name in the source code

#### Example `index.md` File

```markdown
---
title: Build DApps with Wormhole
description: Learn how to use the Wormhole SDK, queries, and Wormhole Connect to build DApps with seamless cross-chain message transfer capabilities.
template: subsection-index-page.html
---
```

Some important things to note:

- The `title` represents the `<title>` tag and is used for SEO purposes
- The `description` represents the meta-description and is also used for SEO purposes
- The `template` defines the template to be used. It should always be `main-index-page.html` for top level directories or `subsection-index-page.html` for subdirectories

### Adding Pages to Existing Subdirectory

If you are adding pages to a subdirectory, the steps are simplified however, it is important to ensure you complete these steps to display the new page, and it's title, on the documentation site correctly:

- Add the new markdown page to the appropriate subdirectory. Note the filename becomes part of the URL for this page
- Ensure the new content page includes the following:
    - **`title`** - represents the `<title>` tag and is used for SEO purposes (not displayed on the published site)
    - **`description`** - represents the meta-description and is also used for SEO purposes (not displayed on the published site)
    - **Page title** - an H1 heading title to be displayed at the top of the page 
- Consider adding the following optional sections to new pages:
    - **`## Checking Prerequisites` section** - if the guide requires the user to have certain developer tools installed, for example Docker or MetaMask, it should be listed here
    - **`## Getting Started` section** - if this is a 3rd party integration, having links that point to the most important parts of your project's documentation site that helps users to get started with your project

An example new content page might look like:

```md
---
title: Title for SEO purposes
description: Description for SEO purposes.
---

## Modifying Existing Pages

## Adding Code and Text Snippets

Snippets are used to manage reusable lines of code or text. They are organized to mirror the structure of the docs site. For example, if to add a code snippet to the page `build/build-apps/wormhole-sdk.md`, you would place the code snippet in the folder `code/build/build-apps/wormhole-sdk`

To link to a snippet, you can use the following syntax in the Markdown file:

```markdown
--8<-- 'code/<subdirectory>/<snippet-file-name>.md'
```

Code snippets can be written in Markdown or the programming language itself, for example, `.py` for Python, `.js` for JavaScript, etc.

## Adding Images

Images are stored in the `images` subdirectory. They are organized to mirror the structure of the docs site. For example, to add an image to the page `build/build-apps/wormhole-sdk.md`, you would place the image in the folder `images/build/build-apps/wormhole-sdk`

All images for display on the website should be in `.webp` format.

To add an image to your page, you should have [alt text](https://developers.google.com/style/images#alt-text) and use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text goes here](/images/<subdirectory>/<image-file-name>.webp)
```

## Search Enging Optimization (SEO)

Here are some resources to help you create good titles and descriptions for SEO:

- [Google's recommendation on good titles](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearance/title-link?hl=en)
- [Google's recommendation on good descriptions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearance/snippet?hl=en)

In general, titles should be between 50 and 60 characters and descriptions should be between 110 and 160 characters.
