## General Questions

### What is MultiGov?

MultiGov is a cross-chain governance system that extends traditional DAO governance across multiple blockchain networks. It leverages Wormhole's interoperability infrastructure for seamless voting and proposal mechanisms across various chains.

### How does MultiGov differ from traditional DAO governance?

Unlike traditional DAO governance, which typically operates on a single blockchain, MultiGov allows for coordinated decision-making and proposal execution across multiple chains. This enables more inclusive participation from token holders on different networks and more complex, cross-chain governance actions.

### What are the main components of MultiGov?

The main components of MultiGov include:

- **Hub chain** - central coordination point for governance activities
- **Spoke chains** - additional chains where token holders can participate in governance
- **Wormhole integration** - enables secure cross-chain message passing
- **Governance token** - allows holders to participate in governance across all integrated chains
