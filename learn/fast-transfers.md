# Fast Transfers

## Overview

Fast Transfers is an innovative protocol that facilitates rapid and efficient liquidity movement across different blockchain networks. At its core, Fast Transfers employs an auction mechanism where solvers and market makers compete to provide the best rates for cross-chain transactions. The protocol is built on Solana, leveraging its fast finality and low transaction costs to perform background token swaps seamlessly.

The primary goal of Fast Transfers is to eliminate the delays typically associated with cross-chain transfers. Traditional cross-chain transfers require waiting for finality on the source chain, which can be time-consuming, especially for networks like Ethereum, where finality can take up to 15 minutes. Fast Transfers bypasses this delay using a hub-and-spoke model, where Solana is the central hub, concentrating liquidity and enabling quick transfers to the destination chain.

Cross-chain liquidity movement in the broader blockchain ecosystem is crucial as it enables assets and value to flow freely across different networks. However, existing solutions often face challenges such as fragmented liquidity and slow transfer times due to the need for finality on each chain. Fast Transfers addresses these challenges by providing a quicker, more efficient solution that ensures liquidity is readily available where needed, without the typical wait times. This makes Fast Transfers an essential tool for developers looking to build applications that require quick and reliable cross-chain asset transfers.

## Key Concepts

### Requirements to Support Fast Transfers

To support Fast Transfers, a blockchain must meet several key requirements:

- **CCTP USDC (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol USDC)** - the primary requirement is that the chain must support CCTP USDC. This allows for seamless asset transfers using USDC as the intermediary currency across different chains
- **NTT USDC (Native Token Transfers USDC)** - Fast Transfers relies on NTT for chains that don't support CCTP or lack a canonical version of USDC. In this scenario, USDC is locked on the hub chain, and an NTT message is sent to the destination chain to initiate the transfer
- **Liquidity through Wormhole-wrapped assets** - in cases where CCTP USDC or NTT USDC are unavailable, the chain must have liquidity in Wormhole-wrapped assets. These wrapped assets can be used as an intermediate currency to facilitate transfers

### Hub and Spoke Model

Fast Transfers utilizes a hub-and-spoke model to manage liquidity and execute cross-chain transfers efficiently. In this model:

- **Hub chain** - Solana is the central hub where all liquidity is concentrated. Solana is chosen due to its fast finality, low transaction costs, and robust support for CCTP. By concentrating liquidity on Solana, the protocol can facilitate quick and efficient transfers to various destination chains
- **Spoke chains** - these are the destination chains to which assets are transferred. Tokens are routed through the hub chain (Solana) rather than being transferred directly between the source and destination chains. This approach allows for a more streamlined and efficient transfer process

### How It Works

Fast Transfers operates through a series of well-defined steps to ensure quick and reliable cross-chain transfers:

1. **Hub chain** - the transfer process begins by moving assets from the source chain to the hub chain, Solana. Here, liquidity is concentrated, and the auction process takes place
2. **Auction process** - once the assets reach Solana, an auction is initiated on the hub chain. Solvers, who are market participants, bid to provide the best possible rate for the transfer. The winning solver executes the swap and facilitates the transfer to the destination chain
3. **CCTP** - the protocol uses the [Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)](/learn/messaging/cctp/){target=\_blank} to manage the movement of assets from the hub chain. CCTP handles the burning of tokens on the source chain and the minting of equivalent tokens on the destination chain, ensuring the integrity of the transfer process
4. **[NTT (Native Token Transfers)](/learn/messaging/ntt/ntt-overview/){target=\_blank}** - for chains that do not support CCTP, Fast Transfers employs NTT messages. In this case, USDC is locked on Solana, and an NTT message is sent to the destination chain, triggering the transfer of an equivalent value of tokens
5. **Final transfer** - the final step involves the solvers executing the necessary swaps to provide the user with a useful token on the destination chain. This ensures that the user receives the desired asset promptly, completing the cross-chain transfer process

This structured approach allows Fast Transfers to overcome the limitations of direct chain-to-chain transfers by using Solana as a central hub and leveraging the strengths of CCTP and NTT protocols, ensuring efficient and reliable liquidity movement across multiple chains.

## Auction Mechanism

### Overview of the Auction Mechanism

The auction mechanism is a core component of the Fast Transfers protocol, ensuring users receive the most efficient and cost-effective cross-chain transfers. It operates on the Solana network, where solvers compete to fulfill transfer requests by bidding in a reverse Dutch auction. This competitive environment drives down costs and speeds up the transfer process, benefiting both users and solvers.

### Auction Process

The auction process is designed to be straightforward yet effective, enabling solvers to bid on transfer requests while managing risk through a security deposit system. Here’s a detailed step-by-step breakdown of how the auction mechanism works:

1. **Initiation** - users initiate a transfer through the Fast Transfers protocol, either via a user interface (UI) or directly on-chain. They can choose between a standard transfer, which waits for finality on the sending chain, or a fast transfer, which triggers the auction process. For fast transfers, users specify a maximum fee they are willing to pay and a deadline by which the auction must start. This ensures that the process is both cost-effective and timely
2. **Auction** - the auction begins on the Solana network when a user requests a fast transfer. Solvers monitor the network for these requests and initiate an auction by placing an offer to fulfill the transfer at or below the user’s specified maximum fee. To start the auction, the solver must transfer the amount of USDC requested by the user (X USDC) plus a small security deposit to the Fast Transfer hub on Solana. This deposit acts as a commitment to the process
3. **Competition** - once the auction is initiated, other solvers can participate by submitting lower bids in a reverse Dutch auction. The goal is to provide end users with the best possible rate. If a new solver submits a better offer, the previous solver’s funds (X USDC and the security deposit) are returned, and the new offer takes precedence. This competitive process ensures that users receive the best possible transfer rate 
4. **Fulfillment** - the winning solver must complete the transfer within a predefined grace period to earn their fee and security deposit back. If they fail to do so, their security deposit may be slashed, and the slashed amount is given to the user as compensation for any delays. This incentive mechanism rewards prompt execution.
Upon successful completion, the Fast Transfer hub sends the X USDC to the user’s destination wallet, and the solver receives their security deposit back along with the fee for the transfer
5. **Settle auction** - after the user’s original transfer reaches finality on the source chain, the winning solver can use the finalized Wormhole message to settle the auction with the Fast Transfer hub. This allows the solver to retrieve the original transfer amount (X USDC) back into their wallet

In summary, the auction mechanism ensures competitive pricing and efficient execution by leveraging a marketplace of solvers. The user benefits from lower costs and faster transfers, while solvers can earn fees by participating in the auction and completing transfers promptly.

### Risk Management

The auction mechanism incorporates several risk management features to ensure reliability and protect both users and solvers:

- **Security deposit** - the security deposit is a small amount of USDC that solvers must provide when initiating an auction. This deposit serves as a commitment to fulfill the transfer and is returned upon successful completion
- **Slashing conditions** - if the winning solver fails to complete the transfer within the grace period, their security deposit may be slashed. This slashed amount is awarded to the user as compensation for any delay, incentivizing solvers to act quickly and reliably
- **Ensuring prompt execution and reliability** - the competitive nature of the auction, combined with the risk of losing the security deposit, ensures that solvers are motivated to fulfill transfers promptly. This system helps maintain the overall efficiency and reliability of the Fast Transfers protocol

This auction mechanism is crucial to the Fast Transfers protocol. It provides a robust, competitive environment that drives efficiency and cost-effectiveness in cross-chain transfers.

## Solvers

Solvers are key participants in the Fast Transfers protocol, ensuring liquidity's smooth and efficient movement across different blockchain networks. These entities facilitate cross-chain transfers by providing the necessary liquidity and participating in the auction mechanism that drives the process. Solvers perform several critical functions that are essential to the protocol’s operation:

- **Liquidity Provision** - Solvers manage and supply the liquidity needed to execute cross-chain transfers. Concentrating liquidity on the hub chain (Solana) ensures that assets can be quickly and efficiently transferred to the destination chain. This centralization of liquidity helps streamline the transfer process and reduces the complexity of managing assets across multiple chains
- **Auction Participation and Management** - Solvers actively engage in the auction mechanism. When a user initiates a fast transfer, solvers monitor the network for these requests and start the auction by placing a bid. This bid includes the transfer amount plus a security deposit, which acts as a commitment to complete the transfer. During the auction, solvers compete in a reverse Dutch auction, offering progressively lower fees to secure the transaction. Their participation ensures that users receive the most competitive rates while maintaining the efficiency and speed of the process
- **Transaction Execution and Settlement** - once a solver wins an auction, they are responsible for executing the transfer within a specified grace period. This involves swapping the necessary assets and ensuring the user’s destination wallet receives the correct tokens. After the initial transfer reaches finality on the source chain, the solver settles the auction by retrieving their funds and receiving any applicable fees

Solvers are the backbone of the Fast Transfers protocol. Their roles in providing liquidity, participating in auctions, and managing transactions are crucial to enabling fast, reliable, and cost-effective cross-chain transfers. By ensuring liquidity is always available where it’s needed, solvers help maintain the overall efficiency and reliability of the Fast Transfers process.

### Benefits for Solvers

Participating in the Fast Transfers protocol offers several advantages for solvers:

- **Capital Efficiency** - the hub-and-spoke model used by Fast Transfers allows solvers to concentrate their liquidity on a single hub chain (Solana) rather than spreading it across multiple chains and assets. This consolidation simplifies liquidity management, reduces the need for complex rebalancing, and increases the fees earned per dollar of liquidity
- **Simplified Risk and Reward Structure** - since USDC is the exclusive settlement asset for the Fast Transfers protocol, solvers are insulated from the risks associated with volatile assets. The primary risk solvers need to consider is the finality risk of the source chain transaction. This straightforward risk assessment simplifies the bidding process and makes participation more attractive
- **New Revenue Streams** - by facilitating fast transfers, solvers can earn fees on each transfer they process. This creates a new source of income and allows solvers to capitalize on the growing volume of cross-chain transfers. Given Wormhole's track record of enabling billions of dollars in cross-chain asset transfers, solvers can expect significant opportunities to generate revenue

## Problem Addressed by Fast Transfers

### Liquidity Fragmentation

One of the significant challenges in cross-chain asset transfers is liquidity fragmentation. This issue arises primarily due to the use of wrapped tokens, such as those facilitated by the Wormhole token bridge. When transferring assets like USDC across different blockchain networks, the process often results in the creation of multiple versions of the same token on various chains. For example, transferring native USDC from Solana and Arbitrum to Sui could result in two different tokens being created on Sui, leading to fragmented liquidity pools.

This fragmentation creates inefficiencies in the market, as liquidity is scattered across multiple versions of the same token rather than being concentrated in a single, cohesive pool. This complicates liquidity management and makes it more challenging for users and developers to move assets across chains without encountering delays, increased costs, or the risk of slippage.

### Solution Provided by Fast Transfers

Fast Transfers addresses the issue of liquidity fragmentation by adopting a hub-and-spoke model with Solana as the central hub. Instead of spreading liquidity across multiple chains, Fast Transfers consolidate liquidity on the Solana hub chain. This approach ensures that all transfers, regardless of the source or destination chain, are routed through a single, unified liquidity pool on Solana. By concentrating liquidity in one place, Fast Transfers eliminates the need for multiple versions of the same token across different chains. This reduces fragmentation and enhances the efficiency and reliability of cross-chain transfers. Additionally, using the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) and Native Token Transfers (NTT) within the Fast Transfers framework ensures that assets are transferred quickly and securely, without the typical delays associated with finality times on various chains.

In summary, Fast Transfers solves the liquidity and finality challenges inherent in cross-chain transfers by centralizing liquidity, reducing token fragmentation, and streamlining the transfer process. This makes it easier for developers to build cross-chain applications that are both efficient and user-friendly, ultimately improving the overall experience for users moving assets across different blockchain networks.
