# Wormhole Settlements Overview

Introducing fast, institutional-scale digital asset settlement — a new way to transfer assets across chains.

Swap, bridge, and build across multiple chains with Wormhole Settlement, an intent-based asset transfer for individual users and institutions.
Builders will be able to implement cross-chain functionality within their dApps extremely simply and without compromising user experience, widening the horizons of their product offering and the number and type of users they can cater to.

Settlement will support Ethereum, Ton, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, Unichain, Polygon, Solana, and Sui, with many more on the horizon. It will be powered by Wormhole Messaging, Wormhole NTT, and Circle's CCTP, and built-in collaboration with the intent experts, Mayan Finance.

This represents Wormhole's first step towards optimizing the bridging experience and building a product that users and institutions use daily. Whether it's to send assets between chains, allow institutions to rebalance inventories on-chain cheaply and quickly, or for builders to allow their application to be accessible by any kind of user no matter what assets they hold or what chain they call home.

## Key Features

- **Integrator flexibility** - apps, leveraging the SDK, have the ability to select any one of three potential routes surfaced — each with their own tradeoffs with respect to time vs cost — they may extend this to users as well
- **Scalable liquidity** - taking lessons for the last few months of idiosyncratic yet sharp inflows into the Solana ecosystem, the hub-spoke model of the Wormhole Liquidity Layer and the flexible design of Swift are designed for capital efficiency and meant to serve
- **Arbitrary payload support** - integrators can bundle callData containing arbitrary protocol actions to enable seamless one-click user experiences, e.g., swap plus stake.

## Integrator Paths

### SDK Integrators

Wormhole provides an SDK that enables apps to abstract away the complexity of cross-chain token swaps. The SDK handles route discovery, fee estimation, and transaction construction. Apps can embed this feature in their backend or create an interface for users to quickly bridge into their respective ecosystems.

### NTT Integrators

NTT partners, current and future, can leverage Wormhole Settlement for near-instant NTT transfers from any chain, including Ethereum mainnet and its L2s. This eliminates the need to wait for slow source chain confirmation times (in some instances 15 minutes or more).

### Chain Integrators

Due to the hub-spoke model of liquidity, new chains without proven traction can access the same level of liquidity for cross-chain intent fulfillment from day one of mainnet launch as established ecosystems with clear evidence of adoption.
