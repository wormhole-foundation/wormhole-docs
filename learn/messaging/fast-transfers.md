# Fast Transfers

## Overview

Moving liquidity across different networks in the broader blockchain ecosystem enables assets and value to flow freely. However, challenges such as fragmented liquidity and slow transfer times often hinder this process due to the time-to-finality across various chains. These issues can lead to inefficiencies and delays that negatively impact the user experience and the functionality of decentralized applications.

Fast Transfers is a protocol designed by Wormhole to address these challenges by providing a quick and efficient solution for cross-chain liquidity movement. Leveraging a [hub-and-spoke model](/docs/learn/messaging/fast-transfers/#hub-and-spoke-model) with Solana as the central hub, Fast Transfers consolidates liquidity into a single, unified pool. Solana was specifically chosen for its fast finality and low transaction costs, critical for enabling rapid asset transfers. This approach minimizes fragmentation by eliminating the need for multiple wrapped versions of the same token across different chains, ensuring a more streamlined and efficient transfer process.

The key component of Fast Transfers is its aggregated [auction mechanism](/docs/learn/messaging/fast-transfers/#auction-mechanism), where [solvers](/docs/learn/messaging/fast-transfers/#solvers)/market makers compete to offer the best rates for cross-chain transactions. This competitive environment ensures optimal pricing and efficient execution of transfers, significantly reducing wait times compared to traditional cross-chain methods.

By addressing liquidity fragmentation and transfer delays, Fast Transfers provides developers with a robust and reliable infrastructure for building applications requiring swift and seamless cross-chain asset transfers. This enhancement improves the overall user experience and promotes greater interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem.

This page introduces all relevant concepts to understand how Fast Transfers work, including the auction mechanism, the hub-and-spoke model, and the role of solvers in ensuring liquidity is always available where it’s needed.

## Key Concepts

### Messaging Requirements to Support Fast Transfers

To support Fast Transfers, a blockchain must meet one of the following messaging requirements:

- **CCTP USDC (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol USDC)** - the primary requirement is that the chain must support [CCTP USDC.](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol){target=\_blank} This allows for seamless asset transfers using USDC as the intermediary currency across different chains
- **NTT USDC (Native Token Transfers USDC)** - Fast Transfers relies on [Native Token Transfers (NTT)](/docs/learn/messaging/native-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank} for chains that don't support CCTP or lack a canonical version of USDC. In this scenario, USDC is locked on the hub chain, and an NTT message is sent to the destination chain to initiate the transfer
- **Liquidity through Wormhole-wrapped assets** - in cases where CCTP USDC or NTT USDC are unavailable, the chain must have liquidity in Wormhole-wrapped assets. These wrapped assets can be used as an intermediate currency to facilitate transfers

### Hub and Spoke Model

The hub-and-spoke model is a system architecture commonly used to optimize the movement of assets or information across a network. In this model, a central "hub" acts as the primary point of control and coordination, while "spokes" are the various endpoints or destinations that connect to the hub. This architecture is particularly effective in managing complex systems where resources need to be efficiently distributed and coordinated across multiple locations.

At a high level, the hub-and-spoke model operates as follows:

- **Hub** -  the central node where all resources, data, assets, or information are aggregated and managed. The hub handles the distribution to the spokes, acting as a central point of processing and coordination. In the context of Fast Transfers, Solana serves as the hub chain where all liquidity is concentrated. Solana was chosen due to its fast finality, low transaction costs, and strong support for the [Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)](https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol){target=\_blank}. By consolidating liquidity on Solana, Fast Transfers can efficiently manage the distribution of assets across multiple chains through a competitive auction mechanism. Additionally, CCTP USDC is used as the base asset, ensuring that USDC liquidity is available for moving assets across different chains
- **Spokes** - the spokes are the endpoints connected to the hub. They rely on the hub to receive and send resources or information, creating a streamlined and centralized flow. In the case of Fast Transfers, these are the destination chains to which assets are transferred. Rather than transferring tokens directly between source and destination chains, Fast Transfers routes all transactions through the Solana hub. This routing allows for a more streamlined and efficient transfer process, reducing the complexity and delays that can arise from managing direct transfers between multiple chains

This model is highly efficient because it aggregates control and reduces the complexity of direct interactions between each endpoint. Instead of managing multiple direct connections, each spoke only needs to connect to the hub, simplifying the overall system and ensuring that liquidity is effectively utilized where it is needed most.

### How It Works

Fast Transfers operates through a series of well-defined steps to ensure quick and reliable cross-chain transfers:

1. **Liquidity aggregation** - the transfer process begins by moving assets from the source chain (a spoke) to the hub chain, Solana. Here, liquidity is concentrated, and the auction process takes place
2. **Auction process** - once the assets reach Solana, an auction is initiated on the hub chain. Solvers, who are market participants, bid to provide the best possible rate for the transfer. The winning solver executes the swap and facilitates the transfer to the destination chain via:
    - **[CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol)](/docs/learn/messaging/cctp/){target=\_blank}** - the protocol uses CCTP to manage the movement of assets from the hub chain. CCTP handles the burning of tokens on the source chain and the minting of equivalent tokens on the destination chain, ensuring the integrity of the transfer process
    - **[NTT (Native Token Transfers)](/docs/learn/messaging/native-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank}** - for chains that do not support CCTP, Fast Transfers employs NTT messages. In this case, USDC is locked on Solana, and an NTT message is sent to the destination chain, triggering the transfer of an equivalent value of tokens
4. **Final transfer** - the final step involves the solvers executing the necessary swaps to provide the user with a useful token on the destination chain. This ensures that the user receives the desired asset promptly, completing the cross-chain transfer process

This structured approach allows Fast Transfers to overcome the limitations of direct chain-to-chain transfers by using Solana as a central hub and leveraging the strengths of CCTP and NTT protocols, ensuring efficient and reliable liquidity movement across multiple chains.

## Auction Mechanism

The auction mechanism is a core component of the Fast Transfers protocol, ensuring users receive the most efficient and cost-effective cross-chain transfers. It operates on the Solana network, where solvers compete to fulfill transfer requests by bidding in a reverse Dutch auction. This competitive environment drives down costs and speeds up the transfer process, benefiting both users and solvers.

### Auction Process

The auction process is designed to be straightforward yet effective, enabling solvers to bid on transfer requests while managing risk through a security deposit system. Here’s a detailed step-by-step breakdown of how the auction mechanism works:

1. **Initiation** - users initiate a transfer through the Fast Transfers protocol, either via a user interface (UI) or directly on-chain. They can choose between a standard transfer, which waits for finality on the sending chain, or a Fast Transfer, which triggers the auction process. For Fast Transfers, users specify a maximum fee they are willing to pay and a deadline by which the auction must start. This ensures that the process is both cost-effective and timely
2. **Auction** - the auction begins on the Solana network when a user requests a Fast Tansfer. Solvers monitor the network for these requests and initiate an auction by placing an offer to fulfill the transfer at or below the user’s specified maximum fee. To start the auction, the solver must transfer the amount of USDC requested by the user (X USDC) plus a small security deposit to the Fast Transfer hub on Solana. This deposit acts as a commitment to the process
3. **Competition** - once the auction is initiated, other solvers can participate by submitting lower bids in a reverse [Dutch auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction){target=\_blank}. The goal is to provide end users with the best possible rate. If a new solver submits a better offer, the previous solver’s funds (X USDC and the security deposit) are returned, and the new offer takes precedence. This competitive process ensures that users receive the best possible transfer rate 
4. **Fulfillment** - the winning solver must complete the transfer within a predefined grace period to earn their fee and security deposit back. If they fail to do so, their security deposit may be slashed, and the slashed amount is given to the user as compensation for any delays. This incentive mechanism rewards prompt execution. Upon successful completion, the Fast Transfer hub sends the X USDC to the user’s destination wallet, and the solver receives their security deposit back along with the fee for the transfer
5. **Settle auction** - after the user’s original transfer reaches finality on the source chain, the winning solver can use the finalized Wormhole message to settle the auction with the Fast Transfer hub. This allows the solver to retrieve the original transfer amount (X USDC) back into their wallet

In summary, the auction mechanism ensures competitive pricing and efficient execution by leveraging a marketplace of solvers. The user benefits from lower costs and faster transfers, while solvers can earn fees by participating in the auction and completing transfers promptly.

### Risk Management

The auction mechanism incorporates several risk management features to ensure reliability and protect both users and solvers:

- **Security deposit** - the security deposit is a small amount of USDC that solvers must provide when initiating an auction. This deposit serves as a commitment to fulfill the transfer and is returned upon successful completion
- **Slashing conditions** - if the winning solver fails to complete the transfer within the grace period, their security deposit may be slashed. This slashed amount is awarded to the user as compensation for any delay, serving as an incentive for solvers to act quickly and reliably
- **Ensuring prompt execution and reliability** - the competitive nature of the auction, combined with the risk of losing the security deposit, ensures that solvers are motivated to fulfill transfers promptly. This system helps maintain the overall efficiency and reliability of the Fast Transfers protocol

This auction mechanism is crucial to the Fast Transfers protocol. It provides a robust, competitive environment that drives efficiency and cost-effectiveness in cross-chain transfers.

## Solvers

Solvers are key participants in the Fast Transfers protocol, ensuring liquidity's smooth and efficient movement across different blockchain networks. These entities facilitate cross-chain transfers by providing the necessary liquidity and participating in the auction mechanism that drives the process. Solvers perform several critical functions that are essential to the protocol’s operation:

- **Liquidity provision** - Solvers manage and supply the liquidity needed to execute cross-chain transfers. Concentrating liquidity on the hub chain (Solana) ensures that assets can be quickly and efficiently transferred to the destination chain. This centralization of liquidity helps streamline the transfer process and reduces the complexity of managing assets across multiple chains
- **Auction participation and management** - Solvers actively engage in the auction mechanism. When a user initiates a fast transfer, solvers monitor the network for these requests and start the auction by placing a bid. This bid includes the transfer amount plus a security deposit, which acts as a commitment to complete the transfer. During the auction, solvers compete in a reverse Dutch auction, offering progressively lower fees to secure the transaction. Their participation ensures that users receive the most competitive rates while maintaining the efficiency and speed of the process
- **Transaction execution and settlement** - once a solver wins an auction, they are responsible for executing the transfer within a specified grace period. This involves swapping the necessary assets and ensuring the user’s destination wallet receives the correct tokens. After the initial transfer reaches finality on the source chain, the solver settles the auction by retrieving their funds and receiving any applicable fees

Solvers are the backbone of the Fast Transfers protocol. Their roles in providing liquidity, participating in auctions, and managing transactions are crucial to enabling fast, reliable, and cost-effective cross-chain transfers. By ensuring liquidity is always available where it’s needed, solvers help maintain the overall efficiency and reliability of the Fast Transfers process.

### Benefits for Solvers

Participating in the Fast Transfers protocol offers several advantages for solvers:

- **Capital efficiency** - the hub-and-spoke model used by Fast Transfers allows solvers to concentrate their liquidity on a single hub chain (Solana) rather than spreading it across multiple chains and assets. This consolidation simplifies liquidity management, reduces the need for complex rebalancing, and increases the fees earned per dollar of liquidity
- **Simplified risk and reward structure** - since USDC is the exclusive settlement asset for the Fast Transfers protocol, solvers are insulated from the risks associated with volatile assets. The primary risk solvers need to consider is the finality risk of the source chain transaction. This straightforward risk assessment simplifies the bidding process and makes participation more attractive
- **New revenue streams** - by facilitating fast transfers, solvers can earn fees on each transfer they process. This creates a new source of income and allows solvers to capitalize on the growing volume of cross-chain transfers. Given Wormhole's track record of enabling billions of dollars in cross-chain asset transfers, solvers can expect significant opportunities to generate revenue
