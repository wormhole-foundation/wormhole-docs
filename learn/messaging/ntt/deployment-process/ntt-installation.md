## Installation

The fastest way to deploy NTT is using the NTT CLI. As prerequisites, ensure you have the following installed:

- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

Install the NTT CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers/cli/cli/install.sh | bash
```

Verify the NTT CLI is installed:
```bash

```
