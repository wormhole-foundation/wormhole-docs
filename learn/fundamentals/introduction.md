# Introduction to Wormhole

Wormhole is a generic _message-passing protocol_ that enables communication between blockchains.

![Message-passing process in the Wormhole protocol](/images/learn/introduction/introduction-1.webp)

!!! note
    The above is an oversimplified illustration of the protocol; details about the architecture and components are available on the [architecture page](/learn/architecture/){target=\_blank}.
This simple message-passing protocol allows developers and users of cross-chain applications to leverage the advantages of multiple ecosystems.

## What Isn't Wormhole?

- **Wormhole is _not_ a blockchain** - it provides a means of communication between blockchains or rollups

- **Wormhole is _not_ a token bridge** - however, there are [protocols built on Wormhole](https://portalbridge.com/#/transfer){target=\_blank} that serve this purpose

## What Can Wormhole Be Used For?

Consider the following examples of potential applications enabled by Wormhole:

- **Cross-Chain Exchange** - using [Wormhole Connect](#){target=\_blank}, developers can build exchanges that allow deposits from any Wormhole-connected chain, significantly increasing liquidity access <!-- Wormhole Connect: Bridging Made Easy -->
- **Cross-Chain Governance** - NFT collections on different networks can use Wormhole to communicate votes cast on their respective chains to a designated "voting" chain for combined proposals
- **Cross-Chain Game** - games can be developed on a performant network like Solana, with rewards issued as NFTs on another network, such as Ethereum

## Get Started

### Quick Start Tutorials

Tutorials are available to get started quickly and explain the concepts involved.

- **[Quick Start - Off Chain](#){target=\_blank}** - integrate Wormhole Connect into a new or existing web UI <!-- Wormhole Connect: Bridging Made Easy -->
- **[Quick Start - On Chain](#){target=\_blank}** - send your first cross-chain message <!-- Developing Cross Chain Dapps -->

More tutorials are available [on github](#){target=\_blank}. <!-- tutorials will be on the docs site -->

## Demos

Demos offer more realistic implementations than tutorials:

- **[Wormhole Scaffolding](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-scaffolding){target=\_blank}** - quickly set up a project with the Scaffolding repo
- **[xDapp Book Projects](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/xdapp-book/tree/main/projects){target=\_blank}** - run and learn from example programs
