# Spy

## Introduction

In the Wormhole context, a _Spy_ is a daemon that subscribes to the gossiped messages in the Guardian Network.

They donâ€™t do any validation work. Instead, they watch the Guardian Network and act as an interface to allow users and applications to check on the Spy-accessible messages.

## Spy-Accessible Messages

The messages available over gossip are things like:

- [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} - packets of cross-chain data. A Spy can see whether a VAA has been approved by the Guardian Network
- [Observations](/learn/glossary/#observation){target=\_blank} - messages emitted by Core Contracts that the Guardians have picked up
- [Guardian heartbeats](/learn/glossary/#heartbeat){target=\_blank} - the liveness of a Guardian

## Source Code

The source code for the Spy is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/node/cmd/spy/spy.go){target=\_blank}.
