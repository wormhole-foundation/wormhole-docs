## Explore Components

The relationship between individual components can be demonstrated through the simplified flow of a multichain message from a source-chain contract to a target-chain contract. Select the title of each step to learn more about that component:

The [Spy](/docs/learn/infrastructure/spy/) continuously runs in the background to subscribe to gossiped messages across the Guardian Network and enable real-time network activity monitoring.
